            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bene long ſince the complaint of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie many, that
thoſe whome they call the Schoolmen and Diſputers, haue giuen the ſtudies
of the holie Scriptures, not onely a great ſtroake, but euen a deathes
wounde. And therfore it will ſeme wonderfull, it may bee vnto ſome, that
the cuſtome of diſputing touching diuine matters, is retained in theſe
Churches and Schooles, which are reformed acording to the pure word of
God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For to diſpute of euery matter (will ſome ſay) is
blame-worthie, neither can it be lawfull to call euery thing into question: but
only ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as being doubtfull and vncertaine in their own nature,
may be argued one boath ſides, according as the opinions and iudgements of
men do vary and diſagree: of which ſorte there are many thinges in
Philoſophie, which do ſo moue the mindes of men with a kinde of
probability, that it may be iuſtly doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether the things be as they
ſeeme or no. But Diuinitie is grounded vpon ſuch a ſure and certain
foundation, that there is no place left therein vnto doubting and
queſtioning. For he himſelfe ſpake, that is not <hi>PYTHAGORAS,</hi> but
<hi>IEHOVA</hi> by his Prophets and Apostles in his word written by them,
tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <pb facs="tcp:1885:3"/> therein, the onely truth of thoſe matters, which
neither eie hath ſeene, eare hath heard, nor euer enterd into the harte of
man, and which they whome God loueth, and who loue him againe, do obtaine of
the mercifull Lord, not by reaſoning, but by beleeuing and leading an holy
life. This reaſon hath ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, that many godly &amp; graue men, haue
either from their hartes as beeing of this iudgement, or for ſome other
cauſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained, from this courſe of diſputing touching diuine
matters. For godlines ſay they, is to bee taught and learned according vnto
the plaine and ſimple maner of Fiſhermen, and not by the ſubtilties of
<hi>ARISTOTLE:</hi> and that doubting of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CADEMICKES</hi> (who as
<hi>AVGVSTINE</hi> ſaith) hold that men are to bee without all hope of
finding the truth, beeing an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that maketh men wauering and changeable,
ready to holde any thing, and to beare any face and countenance, is to be
vtterly remoued from the Church: wherunto you may adde as the Apostle
admoniſheth vs, that we take heed leſt any man ſpoil vs by philoſophy:
neither indeed can it be denied, but that in the very firſt beginning of the
Church there was a very ſore blowe giuen vnto religion, by thoſe who being
ſwollen vppe by the pride of humaine reaſonings, would rather ſubmit
Chriſt vnto their iudgements, then themſelues vnto his maiestie. So that
<hi>TERTVLLIAN</hi> long ſince, iustlie named the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to be the
Patriarches of haereſies. Now in the ages follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that wound was not
onely not healed, but made greater and grieuouſer, by thoſe who mingling
the Schoole Philoſophy with Diuinitie, did make the Ladie and Miſtres, to
bee at the commandement of the ſeruant and handmaide. For the craft of Sathan
was ſuch, that whileſt thoſe, who (being otherwiſe good men) did
endeuour by the light of diſputation, to cleare the truth againſt errors,
they themſelues falling into far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darknes, drewe others after them.
For why ſhould wee not <pb facs="tcp:1885:3"/> ſo account of thoſe queſtionarie
maiſters as they call them? Whereunto (if vnto any other) that which
<hi>AVGVSTINE</hi> allegoricallie ſpake out of the eight Pſalme, concerning
curious men may be moſt fitlie applied. The moſt earneſt and obſtinat
ſtudie (ſaith he,) of all curious men, who ſeeke vaine and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorie
thinges, is like vnto the fiſhe, that walke through the pathes of the Sea:
the which pathes, doe as ſoone vaniſh away and decay, as the water co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
againe together, after it hath giuen place to any that paſſe or ſwimme
thorough it. Thus far <hi>AVGVSTINE.</hi> For what is more curious and more
intricate or brier like, then ſo many (not ſo ſound as ſubtil)
questions, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions, diſtinctions and ſolutions of theſe men, whoe
ſtand gnawing vpon the bones of argumentes as <hi>TERTVLLIAN</hi> ſaith.
Verely that which is ſet downe in the Fables touching <hi>IXION,</hi>
rauiſhing the cloude in ſtead of <hi>IVNO,</hi> whence the
<hi>CENTAVRES</hi> were begotten, who killed one another, may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie aptlie
applied vnto theſe men. For the bare ſhadow in ſteed of the ſolide
truth, being taken holde vpon and apprehended by them, hath altogether drunke
vp, and conſumed the iuyce and moiſture of godlines, ſo that there
remaineth nothing for them, but the dry and wythered barke: and it hath brought
forth ſo many controuerſies and diuerſities of opinions, which teach and
learne nothing els, but brawles and partes taking, that to recall ſo many
mindes and contrarie iudgements that deadlie gore one another vnto concord and
the right rule of reaſon, concord and reaſon it ſelfe cannot ſuffice
and bee able. For as <hi>NAZIANZEN</hi> ſayeth, when as hauing once left
faith, we pretend the force and the abilitie of diſputation, wee do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els thereby, but blot out the authoritie of the Spirit by queſtionings. By
the which vnſuccesſiue and lamentable iſsue, wee are earneſtly
admoniſhed, to betake our ſelues from their traine, who vſe over
narrowlie and curiouſlie to ſift matters, <pb facs="tcp:1885:4"/> vnto the
aſſemblie of thoſe, that are godlie and profitable hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
            <p>But yet this was the falt of theſe men, who in diuinitie
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued not that rule. That nothing ſhoulde bee too much, which is
exceeding profitable in ciuil affaires. For it followeth not, becauſe they
were over curious (which is not to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended) that therefore carefull
diligence ſhoulde bee diſliked, or ſluggiſhnes and ſecuritie thought
praiſe worthie. But holie things as they are to be dealt in with great
iudgment, ſo they are to be handled with greater pietie: for this latter is
as it wer the ſoule, the former being as the eie of diuinitie. The orations
of the Prophets, the ſermons of Chriſte, the writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and
eſpeciallie the Epistles of <hi>PAVL,</hi> do containe moſt ſharp and
graue diſputations, which can in no wiſe bee aptlie diſcuſſed, but by
the vſe of reaſoning. Our Sauiour Chriſt him ſelfe diſputed with the
Doctors, Phariſies, Sadduces, &amp;c. The ſame did <hi>PAVL</hi> with the
Iewes, with the Philoſophers, with the brethren. The Fathers alſo
diſputed: <hi>IRINEVS</hi> againſt the <hi>GNOSTICKES, TERTVLLIAN</hi>
againſt the <hi>MARCIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITES, ATHANASIVS</hi> againſt the <hi>ARRIANES,
NAZI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANZEN, CYRIL, THEODORET, HILLARIE, AVGVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE,</hi> and many others,
almoſt againſt innumerable haereſies: but ſo as their diſputations
wer not a bare exerciſe, or a ſetting forth for a ſhewe of their witts
for delightes ſake: But all of them labored, that their reaſonings and
controuerſies, ſhould not be ſo much ſubtill in ſhewe, as profitable
indeed.</p>
            <p>And diſputations ſaith <hi>AVGVSTINE</hi> become then
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, if nothing els be conſidered in them, but the waies of the Lord
which are mercy and truth: and when al deceit, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie, ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>loue,
and deſire of the victorie is cleane remooued, and when of the contrarie
ſide, the deſire of the truth, the loue and reuerence of Gods maieſtie,
ioyned with modeſtie and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenes <pb facs="tcp:1885:4"/> is vſed therein: So that
whether wee doe louinglie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with our brethren and friends, our mutuall
reaſonings of boath ſides, ought to be as it were a Beſome, to ſweepe
away all errors: or if the aduerſaries and Haeretickes be to be conuinced,
(which <hi>PAVL</hi> requireth of the Pastor,) were neither to ſeek
contention by the truth, nor victorie by contention, but onely the feare of God
and the edification of our neighbour. And it is a notable ſaying, which the
ſame <hi>NAZIANZEN</hi> hath to this purpoſe: namely, that it is not any
great matter to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with wordes or in reaſoning: but it is a great
and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous caſe to loſe the Lorde: and certainely he hath loſt the
Lord, as far as lieth in him, who doth make old lies and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods to
become new ſinnes and tranſgreſsions, as it is in the auncint Prouerbs
among the Greeks. All chriſtian doctors, then are ſo to frame and faſhion
al their Schollers, that they timely ſeaſon them with the iuice of theſe
vertues in ſuch ſort, as when afterwardes they ſhall come abroad from
their priuat ſtudies, vnto any publick calling, they may perpetually retaine
the ſame. This point do we endeuor to perform according vnto our ſlender
abilitie, as in all the partes of our callings, ſo alſo in the exerciſe
of diſputation, according as we are bounde by the lawes of our Schoole: who
in expreſſe tearmes do forbidde, that neither curious nor ſophisticall
propoſitions, nor ſuch as containe falſe doctrine in them be propounded,
and that all wrangling, curioſitie, ſacrilegious boldenes in corrupting the
word of God, euill contention, and obstinat headines be cleane baniſhed from
our diſputations. According vnto which pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, all thoſe that will
ſincearly iudge may perceaue, that theſe Principles haue bene framed. Now
they are publiſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the example of other moſt famous
Schooles, that it may appeare by this patterne of wholſome wordes, boath what
is taught in our vniuerſitie, and after what manner <pb facs="tcp:1885:5"/> the ſame
is deliuered, (the which point alſo, is publicklie made knowne, by many other
the writings of our men:) and withall it may be manifeſted, that we are farre
from the defence of all falſe and erroneous doctrines, as far as our weake
capacitie is able to vnderſtand the truth out of the worde of God alone,
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded purelie, and according to the analogie of faith: and that we may
manifeſt, that as it becommeth honeſt temperat and ſober men, we abhorre
from that ſtagelike vnſeemlines of malepert reuiling, and railing againſt
thoſe, that haue bin fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous men, both for their godlines and learning,
whoſe vertues beeing now as dead Lyons, theſe Hares of our time, or rather
(that I may vſe that old word of <hi>CATO</hi>) theſe woden Images do
reprochefullie defame. And yet do their railinges and ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings light vpon

hauing ſeene heere and there ſome Copies of theſe thinges, entreated both

brought togeather into one bodie, and placed in that orderly ſort, that I

trueth, and what that worde of his is, which he will haue at all times, and in
this age eſpecially maintayned by all men with out exception, that meane to
be partakers of his eternall fauour. The which trueth, as it is largely
contayned in Gods moſt ſacred written word, of the olde and newe
Teſtament, ſo is it briefely ſet downe in this booke, by the whole
conſent of the godly learned in the Churche of Geneua, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by
that famous learned man, vniuerſally reuerenced in Gods Church, M. THEODORE
BEZA. Out of this booke alſo, ſhall appeare, for what cauſe the Churche
of God is at this day perſecuted, whereſoeuer the ſame be hardly
intreated. For this I may boldly affirm, that ther is no church or priuate man
at this houre, in any affliction for the maintenance of the trueth, but the
cauſe of his trouble is contained and defended in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. So that
although all the perſecuted Saints of God, now pilgrimes vpon earth, be not
included within the walles and narow dominions of Geneua, yet doth this booke
manifeſtly prooue, that as that Church is barbarouſly aſſayled by the
Duke of Sauoye within the boundes thereof, ſo is this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therein
profeſſed, hardly delt with vnder their gouernment (though it may be they
are ignorant of it) who woulde be loath to be founde at the ſiege of Geneua,

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1885:7"/>And herby alſo it will be manifeſted, that there

thou art not to chooſe what to defend, but thou art bound to maintaine

felicitie, doth conſiſt in the true kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: it is moſt meet
that all our endeuors ſhould be ſpent, in ſeeking to attain vnto that
knowledge, as far as we may be capable of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Not that a full &amp; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of his
Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, who is far greater, then the capacitie of men, and Angels can
reach vnto, may be any waies comprehended within our vnderſtanding: but that
wee ſhould bend all the powers of our ſoules and bodies, to knowe that one
God, who is the author and giuer, both of ſoule and body.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And although humaine reaſon, bee able to affoord vs ſome
proofs, wherby we may be taught, that there is a God, and but onely one: and
whereby alſo his attributes, may bee in ſome ſort, made knowen vnto vs.
Yet notwithſtanding, thoſe proofes are more ſure and ſtrong, yea, and
altogeather the moſt vndoubted, which for this purpoſe are fetched and
drawen out of Gods word: that is, out of the ſacred writings 
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1885:8"/> of the holie Prophets and Apoſtles, contained in the old
and new Teſtament.</p>
            <p n="4">4 For howbeit, that the knowledge of God, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
from the conſideration of his workes and power, hath many notable vſes: yet
is it nothing comparable, with that light, which is gotten from the holy
Scriptures; both becauſe this knowledge reuealed by the word, doth wholie
flow and proceede from God him ſelfe: and alſo, in aſmuch as, God in this
his written woorde, hath manifeſted, howe, and after what manner, he will be
knowen, and worſhipped of men.</p>
            <p>Now, whether there be a God or no, we are to be ſo farre from
making any queſtion thereof, that wee are bound moſt firmely, with all our
hearts, without all wauering and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to beleeue that point.</p>
            <p>And therfore we auouch, that the rauing madnes of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,
who make a queſtion, whether there be a God or no, ought not ſo much to be
confuted by words and reaſon, as it ought to bee cleane rooted out of the
ſocietie of men by the Magiſtrat, and the ſtiffe maintainers of it, taken
from amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt men.</p>
            <p>For though al men by nature, as it is now corrupt, be void of the
true God: neuertheleſſe, there are certaine motions and ſparks of the
knowledge of God, imprinted in the mind of euery man, which cannot altogeather
be put out: And as theſe motions doe teſtifie, that man was borne to
worſhippe God: So vnles, a more full light bee joyned vnto them, they leaue
man ſtraying and groping in the darke, and are ſmallie or nothing behoofull
vnto him.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as the knowledge, which man hath by nature, is not
altogeather of no vſe vnto ſaluation: ſo is it verie farre, from being of
it ſelfe, ſufficient therunto: It bereaueth them indeede of all excuſe,
who quench that ſmall lighr of nature, though neuer ſo corrupt, which is
left in them.</p>
            <p n="5">5 True it is indeed, that he who goeth beyond al bounds, can
in no wiſe be defined, and that that exceeding brightnes of God, which no man
can attaine vnto, cannot bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by our darknes, yet hee may be, as
it were, ſhadowed out by this diſcription, and ſo wee may ſay, that God
is hee <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1885:8"/> who hath his beeing in himſelfe, whoſe nature is
of himſelfe, inuiſible without beginning, without ending, infinite,
incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, indiuiſible, vnchangeable, no bodily ſubſtance, but
a being moſt pure, moſt ſimple, and euery way moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, wiſe,
mightie, good, iuſt, mercifull, free, who hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things of
nothing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And therfore, we do deteſt the multitude of Gods, ackno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
among the Gentils, the groſnes of the 
<note n="*" place="margin">Heretiks ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they held
God, to haue a body and members like a man.</note> Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphites, the
furie of the Manichaeis, and all ſuch like. And here it is to be obſerued,
that thoſe things which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto God, by the former Epithites and
attributes, are not to betaken, as qualities inhaerent in him: for we are to
knowe, that there is nothing in God, which is not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 As where it is ſayd, that God is iuſt, good, merciful,
&amp;c. That is ſo to bee vnderſtood, as if hee were ſaid to be
iuſtice, goodnes, and mercy it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>And therefore, although that when we ſpeake of God, we muſt not
conceiue of him, as hauing any liknes or affinitie with the nature of man, or
of any creature: yet ſuch is the excellencie of the Lorde, and mans weaknes,
that when wee ſpeake of his Majeſty, we are enforced to vſe borrowed

neither are they to be rejected, as adding any thing vnto the word, but rather,
to bee ſtill profitablie, and wholſomelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4 By the word TRINITY, we vnderſtand the no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the

            <p n="5">5 By the word eſſence, in this doctrin is ment, that which

            <p n="7">7 The proprieties whereby the perſons are diſtinguiſhed,
are the diuers maner of being, that they haue in the Deitie, whereby the

            <p n="8">8 The diuine Eſſence, the Deitie or Godhead, &amp; God,

            <argument>
               <p>HITHERTO CONCERNING, THE PERSONS of the Father, and the Sonne: it
followeth now, that we ſpeake of the holie Spirit.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 VVHereas the word SPIRIT, is diuerſly taken in the
ſcriptures, we in this doctrine, do vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the holie ſpirit, the
third perſon in Trinitie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The holie Spirit is that Eſſentiall, and working power,
who is eſſentially ſubſiſting in the Father, and the Son, from whome
(the whole Deity wherein alſo they doe ſubſiſt, being communicated vnto
him after an vnſpekable maner) though he procedeth, or (if we may ſo
ſpeake) is as it were breathed, yet is he not at all ſeperated in reſpect
of this his proceding, but is in regard of the maner of his being,
diſtinguiſhed from the perſons of the Father, and the Sonne.</p>
            <p>And therefore he is not without cauſe reckoned, the third perſon
in nomber, ſeing in conſideration of his being, hee is referred vnto the
Father, and the ſonne, yet not as vnto two beginnings, but as vnto one.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Deity thus communicated, by iſſuing and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
is not multiplied in ſubſtance, ſeing he is moſt ſimple and ſingle:
Whence it is that the holie Ghoſt in regard of his perſon, is, and euer
hath bin coeſſentiall, and coaeternall with the Father, and the ſonne,
and in regarde of his ſubſtance, is that one onely true God in himſelfe:
Wherevpon alſo, the name of God, is ſometimes perſonally attributed vnto
him.</p>
            <p>The holy Ghoſt is therefore to be worſhipped, by the one and the
ſame faith and inuocation, that the Father and Son are.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And although the works of the Trinnitie, which they cal
outward, or external, are vnſeperable, yet in the effecting of them, wee are
to obſerue a diſtinction, not onelye of the perſons, but alſo of the
perſonall actions.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The proper, and the peculiar action of the holie Spirit, 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1885:11"/> in all the workes of the Deity, bee they naturall and
ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or els extraordinary; was and is to effect in his time and maner,
thoſe things which the father from all aeternitie hath decreed in his owne
wiſdome, that is, in his Son, and the Son hath ordered and diſpoſed to
come to paſſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Yet is not the holy ſpirit any inſtrumental cauſe,
affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his helpe as a ſeruaunt vnto the Father or the Son, but working
together with them, without any inferioritie or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequallitie.</p>
            <p n="7">7 But the power and working of the holy ſpirit, is
eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie ſeene, in the planting and gouerning of the Church: In which
particular reſpect, he is called the holie ſpirit: even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that he
who is moſt holie, doth ſtirr vp and nouriſh, all the holie motions that
are in the elect. For he it is, by whoſe inſpiration, all the holie
prophets haue ſpoken; it is he, that giueth eares to heare, and a hart to
beleeue, who appointeth Paſtors, and doth enable them with neceſſary
gifts, who ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp the ſlouthfull, and being the true comforter
indeed, doth comfort the afflicted ſoule: By whome thoſe that are borne
againe of him, do cry Abba father, he alſo formed the fleſhe of Chriſt in

nature: to conclude, it is he by whoſe ſtrength we ſtand vntill we

            <p>Wherefore, we doe abhor and renounce the SABELLIANS who confound the

               <p>HITHERTO WE HAVE SPOKEN OF GOD, both as far as wee are able to
attaine vnto, bee the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; alſo, as he is laied before vs
in the holy Scripturs, to be three in perſon, and one in ſubſtance: now
it followeth, that we intreat of his attributes, wherby in a ſort, we are
taught, what maner of God he is.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 ALthough there be no compoſition in God, nor yet any
accidentall qualitie, ſeeing hee is a ſubſtance moſt ſingle and euery
way one, yet to the end that according vnto our capacitie we might
vnderſtande what a God hee is, he himſelfe in the ſcriptures is
accuſtomed to attribute vnto himſelfe many things, as qualities.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By attributes in this place then, we vnderſtande the
eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall proprieties of the Deity, which are attributed vnto him in the
ſcriptures.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Theſe things are ſo attributed vnto him, that
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they place nothing in him that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or diuers from
his ſubſtance, but look whatſoeuer they point him out to be, the very
ſame he is in his owne moſt ſimple ſubſtance.</p>
            <p n="4">4 For, both theſe proprieties, and alſo their actions doe
in very deede, differ no whit from the ſubſtance of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: but onely
in ſome conſideration we are to holde them diuers both from the diuine
ſubſtance, and alſo the on from the other.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Now theſe things are attributed vnto the Deity,
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiuely, &amp; ſomtims adjectiuely as they ſpeak,
that we may thereby knowe him to be a being that ſubſiſteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, and
that he is ſuch a one, not by participation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectlie, but of
himſelfe, and that moſt perfectlie.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Of attributes we make two kinds: the one is, of them which
are ſo proper vnto the Deitie, that they can bee in no <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1885:12"/>
ſort communicated vnto creatures, neither haue they anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect
vnto creatures, ſaue that by them, the Deitie is diſtinguiſhed from
creatures; of this kind are, aeternity, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenes, vnmeaſurablenes,
omnipotencie.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The other kind is of thoſe, who although ſimply, and as
far as they are in the Deitie, they cannot be communicated; yet creatures may
be partakers of them, not properly, but by analogie, and a kinde of agreement,
and that not eſſentially, but in regarde of qualitie, and but in part
neither: ſuch ar wiſedome, goodnes, and the reſt of that kind.</p>
            <p>Therefore OSIANDER erred groſly, whoe taught that the
eſſentiall righteouſnes of God, was communicated vnto vs, and at this day
their error is intollerable, who recalling back again the blaſphemie of
EVTYCHES, holde that al the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of the Deitie, were powred by
perſonall vnion, into the fleſh, which the Sonne of God tooke vpon him.</p>
            <p n="8">8 For whatſoeuer is not the diuine eſſence, thervnto the
eſſentiall attributes of the Deitie cannot be communicated.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The actions furthermore, which we ſaid to be alſo
attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the Deitie, wee deuide both into thoſe which they call
remaining, becauſe they doe ſo continue in the Deitie that worketh, as they
bring forth no worke out of the doer, of which ſort are prouidence and
predeſtination: and alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe which may be tearmed paſsing, that
is, thoſe which leaue ſome worke out of the doer, or doe inferre a
ſuffering vnto ſome thing, as are creation and redemption.</p>
            <p n="10">10 As for the attributes, which haue their names from the
effects proceeding from God vpon the creatures, thogh they ſeeme to haue had
their beginning in time, as where God is called the Creator, redeemer, &amp;c.
yet wee denie, that either they put any change in God, or do agree vnto him by

            <argument>
               <p>THE ATTRIBVTES OF GOD IN GENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall haue bene dealt with: now
ſome of them in ſpeciall are to be handled.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 THe omnipotencie of God, is that very immeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and
infinite eſſence of God, which is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable vnto no creature; alwaies
doing, neuer ſuffering; and which cannot deciſt to be that which it is.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This being in deed but one, may yet in diuerſe
conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, be ſaid to be manifolde.</p>
            <p n="3">3 For the omnipotencie is one way conſidered, when we
ſpeake of it, as God doth alway worke in him ſelfe, &amp; it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
way regarded, in reſpect that God worketh out of him ſelfe, and can worke
innumerable thinges, if it pleaſeth him.</p>
            <p n="4">4 For wee hold, that God is omnipotent, in as much as,
beſides that, he is able to do whatſoeuer he will; he can both will and do
innumerable things, which hee will neuer, either will or doe.</p>
            <p>We do therefore condemne them, who ſay, that God is for no other
cauſe omnipotent, but in as much, as hee can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, worke
whatſoeuer can bee, either ſpoken or imagined. And we doe diſlike of
them, who thinke, that God is in that reſpect, onely called omnipotent,
becauſe he can do onely whatſoeuer he will: For his power is in it ſelfe
infinite, whereas his will is as it were, bounded, within the verie act of
will.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Now we hold, that God cannot do any of theſe things, which
either are repugnant vnto his perſonall proprieties, (as that the Father
cannot bee begotten, neither the Sonne begotten) or are contrarie vnto his
eſſence, as to be finite; or which implie a contradiction, of which ſort,
it is to make, that a bodie ſhall bee truly naturall, and yet, neither to
haue quantity, nor to be contained in any place. Brieflie we denie, 
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1885:13"/> that God can doe any thing, which if they were done, might
ſhew him to haue defects and weaknes in him, as to die, to lie, to ſinne,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6 And as by faith, we beleeue according vnto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the Creeds appointed in the church, that God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is omnipotent, ſo we
do profeſſe and publiſh the ſame with our mouth.</p>
            <p n="7">7 For it is no leſſe repugnant vnto his nature, that there
ſhould be many omnipotents, then that there ſhould be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gods.</p>
            <p>Whence it is, that Chriſtian Religion, doeth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in
God diſtinct into three perſons, three omnipotents, but one omnipotent.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the humane nature of Chriſt, although it be vnited
vnto the deuine, in the perſon of the Sonne, who is but one, yet as it is not
therefore made God, ſo is it not properlie made omnipotent: but it retained
even it own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, before it was glorified, wherein it might ſuffer
and dye for vs, and now being glorified, although it be free from all
infirmities and glorious; yet is it not in it ſelfe made om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent.</p>

            <p n="4">4 For although the eſſence of God, and therefore alſo
his wil be moſt ſimple; yet we deny not the ſame to be manifold, both in
reſpect of the things which, and of the maner howe it willeth thoſe things
to be.</p>
            <p n="5">5 But looke howe that vnchaungeable decree of his, is ſuch,
as it cannot but be done, will we, nill wee; euen ſo, that wil of his, which
the Morall law doth lay open, is not alwaies fulfilled: for the reprobate doe
purpoſely repugne the ſame, and the elect, by reaſon of the corruption of
their nature, (which with griefe they acknowledge) cannot fullie obey it.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Further, ſeing there is nothing either greater or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then God, wee account it vnlawfull, to ſeeke any cauſe of his will, either
out of him, or aboue him, and ſo we holde his goodnes to bee the cauſe of
all thinges, that hee will haue done.</p>
            <p>Wherevpon we doe juſtlie condemne the olde PELLAGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANS, and the
halfe PELLAGIANS of our age, to wit, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; who bable, that God was
moued to decree what ſhould <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1885:15"/> be the end of reaſonable
creatures, by the foreknowledge he had, either of their faith, or of their
workes.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Thoſe things which God willeth concerning himſelfe, he
cannot but will them: but as for ſuch things as he willeth concerning others;
them he willeth freelie: yet ſo, as ſome of them doe neceſſarilie come
to paſſe and worke: others, as it falleth out, of their own accord.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing it is the cauſe of all thinges, wee beleeue, that
both good and euill, doe come to paſſe at the appointment thereof, in
ſuch ſort, as whereas God is moſt good; ſo his will is moſt vpright,
and the rule of all juſtice, ſo as it can not command any thing that is
euill.</p>
            <p>Now although in Chriſt God and man, there be a double will; his
diuine will is yet ſo immutable, as it cannot will any new thing; but
whatſoeuer it willeth, the ſame it willed from aeternitie; neither dooth it
repent him of any thing hee hath done, ſeeing he is God indeed, and from all
aeternitie.</p>

            <head>THE NINTH SORT OF PRINCIPLES, CONCERNING THE GOODNES, FAVOR,
LOVE, AND MERCIE OF GOD.</head>
            <p>THe goodnes of God, we call that eſſentiall proprietie of his,
whereby hee is good in himſelfe, and bountifull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all his
creatures.</p>
            <p n="2">2 God is ſo exceedinglie good, that from him can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
nothing but good.</p>
            <p>Whence it is, that euill is directlie repugnant vnto his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
much leſſe, can he be thought to be the authour of euil.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And although a proofe of Gods goodnes, bee powred vpon euery
creature, general and perticular: yet he doth not in the ſame meaſure,
communicate the ſame vnto al of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Now, whereas this goodnes turneth vnto the diſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
the wicked, the fault is their owne; and that becauſe they do either not
imbrace the ſame, with a ſure confidence, or els doe contemptuouſlie
refuſe it.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1885:15"/>5 The word Grace or Fauor, which is taken
in diuerſe ſens, doth in this place ſignify the free fauor of God, which
is only peculiar vnto the elect, which doth not only frame our will, being
freed from corruption, to will &amp; to do that which is good, but alſo doth
continually vphold the ſame, which otherwiſe would fall to decay of it
ſelfe, vnleſſe that ſupplying grace, did make the firſt grace to be
of efficacie and force.</p>
            <p n="6">6 This grace is neither from nature, as the PELLAGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANES did
falſly judge, neither yet is it any habit infuſed in vs: neither doth it
become ours by any other means, then as farre as we apprehend the ſame by
true fayth in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This ground being layed, wee affirme, that grace and merits of
worke, can in no wiſe ſtand together.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The loue that is in God, is no paſsion ariſing of ſome
good that it aprehendeth, but it is the verie ſimple eſſence of God, who
is graciouſly affected towardes his creatures, and bleſſeth them as he
thinketh good.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But the cauſe of that loue of his, is not in the
cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, as though they were ſuch, as could allure God to loue them, but
it is rather in God, who of himſelf is good, and powreth goodnes vpon his
creatures.</p>
            <p n="9">9 In like ſort, God is called mercifull; not becauſe hee
is ſubject vnto any perturbation, but in aſmuch as hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth miſery
from thoſe whome he loueth.</p>
            <p>And although amongſt men, mercie ſeemeth to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vnto
judgement, as a thing that can not ſtand with it, yet in God, theſe two doe
verie well agree, ſeeing mercy is not contrary vnto judgement; but juſtice
being as it were ſubdued by mercie; doeth in reſpect of vs, ſeeme to giue
place vnto mercie.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>NOW THAT WE HAVE SPOKEN OF GODS Prouidence: it followeth that we
deale of Praedeſtination.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 FIrſt in generall, Praedeſtination is that aeternal and
immouable decree of GOD, whereby, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1885:17"/> his
Majeſtie; he hath decreed all things, both vniuerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and particularlie;
and alſo doth effect them by the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes created in like ſort, &amp;
appointed by him, as he thoght good to the laying open of his owne glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondlie, applying this decree in ſpeciall vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
Wee call Praedeſtination, that aeternall decree (ſuch as we haue alreadie
ſpoken of:) whereby, he hath immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly purpoſed from all aeternity, by
ſauing ſome in his great mercie, and by damning others in his moſt juſt
ſeueritie, to manifeſt himſelfe, what he is indeed by his effects;
namely, that he is moſt mercifull and moſt juſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Among thoſe ſecond cauſes, as farre as they concern
mankind; whom properlie this diſcourſe reſpecteth; we are to conſider
two, vz. the vnderſtanding, and the will, as the ſpring of the actions of
men.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It behooued God, being in time to execute the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of
this aeternall Praedeſtination, otherwiſe hee ſhould bee the authour of
ſinne (which cannot be) to create man good; that is, ſuch, as both the
judgement of his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, could well and vprightlie ſee into the
things laid before him, and vprightly judge of them, and alſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of his will ſhould be juſt, and euery way euen.</p>
            <p n="5">5 It behoued alſo, that this man ſhould be indued with a
free and a voluntarie power, to mooue himſelfe, to the end, that this power
ſhould be a forcible and a ſelfe-moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beginning of the actions of
man.</p>
            <p n="6">6 It behooued this man alſo to haue abilitie, if hee wold,
to fall from this vprightnes and goodnes, that a way might be opened, both vnto
the mercie, and the juſtice of God.</p>
            <p n="7">7 It is ſo far then, that God bereaued our firſt Parents
of the liberty of humaine will, &amp; the voluntarie inclination to be caried
both waies, that on the other ſide he made no alteration in the ſame:
Otherwiſe, as God was the Author; ſo he might be accounted the deſtroyer
thereof.</p>
            <p n="8">8 For the aeternall purpoſe of God, doth impoſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neceſsity vpon the euents, which he hath determined, then ſuch as hee will
haue ſecond cauſes, to be mooued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1885:17"/> vnto their
owne nature: whence it followeth, that it doth not take away the contingencie
or voluntarines of mans will, as ſhall be diſcuſſed more fullie, God
willing, in the diſcourſe concerning the nature of man.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Thoſe two therefore, who were the firſt of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
althogh in regard of that which was to come to pas, they fell not without the
vnchaungeable appointment of God; yet in reſpect of the cauſe inhaerent in
them, and the proper beginning of their actions, they fell contingentlie, not
by conſtraint, but willinglie, and altogeather by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie inward
motion; both in reſpect of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, who blinded, and of the will
who depraued it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Therfore, we do retaine theſe Scholaſticall
diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of neceſsitie and compulſion, of naturall and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
of abſolute and conditionall, of enforced and enſuing neceſsitie, as true
and profitable.</p>
            <p n="11">11 This fall brought with it, that which was conuaied vnto
all men, as GOD had threatned; to wit, the bondage of darknes in the whole
mind, &amp; of rebellion againſt God, in the whole will of man.</p>
            <p n="12">12 And althogh, the liberty of making choiſe between good
and euill; but not betweene euill and euill, be nowe altogeather loſt, yet
there remaine ſtill, both in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and alſo in the will,
though ſeruaunts vnto ſinne, certaine voluntarie motions.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Out of this bondage, God, who is bound vnto no man, doth,
when he thinketh good, call &amp; enlighten thoſe whome according vnto his
aeternall fore-appointed electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Chriſt, it pleaſed him of his meere
mercie, to chuſe, and hauing beſtowed faith vppon them, and regenerated
them, hee freelie iuſtifieth them in the ſame Chriſt; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one day to
lay open, in them being glorified, the great glorie of his great and
vnſpeakeable mercie.</p>
            <p n="14">14 We doe condemne therefore all thoſe, who appoint the
foreſight and foreknowledge, either of faith or works, as a praeexiſtent or
foregoing cauſe of election, which was fore-ordained from aeternitie: neither
do we teach, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie man was elected; becauſe he ſhould either beleeue,
or <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1885:18"/> doe well; but contrariwiſe, that they therefore are
indued with faith, who doe beleeue; and that they labour to doe well, who are
carefull of good workes; becauſe that God of his meere free goodnes, did
appoint them vnto ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therfore to haue faith in Chriſt, and the
true fruits of faith.</p>
            <p n="15">15 The certaintie of this Election, is not to bee fetched
from that aeternall decree, known onelie vnto God; nor yet from a generall
calling, but from the gifts inhaerent in vs, and the effects proper vnto the
elect; that is, from the good motions of the vnderſtanding and the will, we
muſt fetch the gift of true regeneration, peculiar onely vnto the elect; and
from Regeneration, we muſt gather that vnrepentant gift of imputed
righteouſnes: From hence againe, by our effectual calling, we muſt ariſe
to the full aſſurance of faith, and the teſtimony of the Spirit of
adoption in vs, and from thence laſt of all; we are by little and little, to
climbe higher &amp; higher, vnto the full aſſurance of our free aeternall
Praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination in Chriſt, which is joyned with continuall praier, hearing
of Gods word, and perſeuerance in well doing.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Now all thoſe, whome it pleaſeth the ſame GOD, who
is debter vnto no man, in juſtice to leaue in their own corruption; either
altogeather not called, or called; but without the opening of the heart, and
worthelie to deliuer vp vnto Sathan, and their owne concupiſcence; being
ſuch alſo, as wilfully and willinglie harden themſelues; will hee one
day, according vnto his aeternall Praedeſtination, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge togeather with
Sathan vnto aeternall puniſhments, laying open in their iuſt deſtruction,
the glorie of his great and moſt iuſt hatred againſt euill.</p>
            <p n="17">17 The manifeſting of this decree of Reprobation, is to be
left vnto God, vnleſſe it be apparant in any, that they haue ſinned
againſt the holie Ghoſt, as in times paſt, it was with IVLIAN the
Apoſtata. The cauſe, why wee are not to determine of Rebrobation, from the
effects of Sathan and our corruption (that ſinne againſt the holie Ghoſt
onelie excepted) as wee are to gather our Election from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the
holie Spirite in vs, is this: Euen becauſe it hath <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1885:18"/>
pleaſed our mercifull GOD, to ſhew that ſome, yea of the greateſt
ſinners, at their very laſt gaſp, were of the number of his elect, by
beſtowing forgiuenes of ſins vpon them by his extraordinary fauour, as it
fell out with the theefe that hung vpon the Croſſe.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Thoſe therefore, who holde on the waye of
deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, are ſo to bee tolde of their dutie, as leauing vnto God the
ſecrets of his judgements, we are not to diſpaire of anie mans ſaluation.
For it is a true conſequence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to ſay; I beleeue, as it appeareth by
the effects: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am elected and appointed vnto ſaluation: But it is
no neceſſarie conſequent to ſay: I do not beleeue, and I tread the path
of deſtruction, therefore I am a reprobate, and appointed to damnation. For
he that beleeueth not to day, may bee endued with faith to morrow. But thus
rather we are to make a true concluſion. I do neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Goſpell,
nor labour to beleeue, but continue in the way of deſtruction. Wherefore,
except I betake mee vnto an other courſe, I ſhall periſh. And therfore I
wil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto an other way, which God laieth before mee. And theſe are the
cogitations, which all paſtors are bound by duty with great care to lay
before their wandring ſheepe.</p>
            <p n="19">19 God therfore in appointing ſome of free-gift vnto
ſaluation, and others vnto juſt condemnation; is neither author of ſinne,
nor reſpecter of perſons: but thereby ſheweth himſelf to be the true
God in deed.</p>

            <p n="2">2 The alone ſoueraigne cauſe therefore of the world, and

manner of men, but without all labour: and alſo without the worke, help, and
ſeruice of anie other, but by his word alone; that is, by his Sonne, through
the power of the holie Ghoſt. For the workes of the Trinitie, are
vnſeparable.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Neither did he frame all thoſe things of anie fore-being
ſtuffe or matter, but euen of nothing; that is, from that which was not, by
his word alone he gaue being, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all things that are.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Philoſophers therefore doe erre, who held, that the world
was aeternall; and thoſe alſo who deemed it, to haue bene made and formed
of moates by chance, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theſe who taught, this viſible worlde
to haue bene framed by ſome other then by God. In which error was CERINTHVS,

            <p n="7">7 Now all theſe things, which God created, could not but be
good, ſeing he himſelfe is moſt good; for they were created of him
exceedinglie good, and moſt pure without all corruption; hauing nothing in
them, which did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the omnipotencie, and the exceeding goodnes of the
Creator. In this originall integritie, men and euill Angels, might haue ſtill
continued, if they had woulde; and men might haue conuayed the ſame vnto
their poſteritie: In ſtead whereof; God, for the ſinne of man, did
curſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Creatures, which he had created for mans ſake.</p>
            <p n="8">8 As concerning Euill: it is not anie thing created or hauing
beeing, but onelie ſignifieth the meere abſence of the good, that ought to
be preſent; neither is it in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as an accident, but as Priuation
oppoſite vnto good; rather expelling the ſame, then hauing beeing in it
ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="9">9 And although it doth marre that, which otherwiſe is good
in it ſelfe; yet is it by accident, the cauſe of good: That the degrees of
thinges created may appeare, which haue their ſtate, according as they haue
the greater, or leſſe good in them. So vnto the good of all things in
generall, Euill ſeemed to bee in ſome ſort neceſſary. And ſo
AVGV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STINE ſaith; that God was the Author of good, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer of
euill.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Nowe, ſeeing that Euill is not any thing, that hath 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1885:20"/> being in nature: it followeth, that there can be no

de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from that, which is the chiefe, and the ſoueraigne good, which
onelie is God alone, bleſſed and mightie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all.</p>
            <p>Wee doe therefore condemne, the MARCIONITES, the MANICHAEES and
others; who haue taught, that there was two beginnings, the one contrary vnto
the other; that is, two Gods, the one good, of whome the inuiſible,
ſpiritual, and good Creatures haue had their beginning. The other euill; from
whence all viſible, corporall, and corrupt things haue iſſued: whereas
indeed all things are good, in regard of their beeing, and the euill that is in
them, hath procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the corruption and defect of their being.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 SPirits then are ſubſtances, created of nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bodies, and inviſible; yet finite in regard of the proprietie of their
nature; good indeed, but ſo, as they wer created by God, of a changeable
goodnes. Of this ſort, are thoſe which we call Angels, and the ſoules of
men.</p>
            <p n="2">2 All Angels were at the firſt created good, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an vnderſtanding of moſt ſurpaſsing excellencie; and being of
nature moſt ſimple next vnto God; they were al at once created in the
beginning, &amp; not to take encreaſe by any propagation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The name of Angels, is attributed to thoſe Spirits, to
declare their office; namelie, that they are, as it were, the 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1885:20"/> meſſengers and officers of God; eſpeciallie thoſe
of them, that continued in the truth: of whom we will ſpeake in the firſt
place.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The names of thoſe, doe partlie ſhewe the excellencie of
their nature, as when they are called, SERAPHIM and CHERVBIM, and partlie
declare, the dignitie of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice wherevnto they are ſent; of which
ſort, are the names of MICHAEL, GABRIEL, RAPHAEL, ſpoken of in the
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>The like names of Angels, mencioned in the bookes of CABALISTS and

            <p n="5">5 And as for the diſputation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning their degrees, that
of all other things is moſt vaine, and ſo is the queſtion concerning the
time of their creation: ſeeing that the lord hath not opened this miſterie
vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Of theſe Angells, ſome thorough Gods grace, haue
continued in the truth, that is, in that bleſſed and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſtate
wherein they were created, attending as diligent ſeruants vpon God, that they
might be readie, to execute his commandements, both for the furthering of the
ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints, &amp; alſo for the execution of the juſt
judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</p>
            <p n="7">7 In the performing of theſe commaundements, they haue often
times appeared trulie viſible, and palpable, by taking vpon them the ſhape
of a man, or ſome other form, being for a ſet time, clad with true bodies,
to bring to pas bodily actions: It being the will of God, that they ſhould
thus far frame themſelues vnto the capacitie of men. But whence they tooke
theſe bodies, and whether they faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them vnto themſelues, with all
ſuch like points as are laied vp onely in the ſecret counſell of God; we
hold it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for vs to ſearch.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Now the reſt of the Angels, the number whereof, are alſo
exceedinglie manie, wilfullie and willinglie changing themſelues, and
departing from the truth, hee being their guide and Captaine, as it were, who
is peculiarlie named Sathan, (that is, the aduerſarie of God) and the Deuill,
are <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1885:21"/> by the juſt judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, of thoſe that were
moſt good become moſt euil; but not bereaued of vnderſtanding and
judgement: Wherefore alſo they are called by a Greeke name,

            <p n="9">9 And although, theſe wicked Angels, do with all their

owne, and partlie, to execute his judgementes againſt the enemies of his
name; in ſuch ſort, as hee turneth their wicked endeuours, and purpoſes,
vnto the cleane contrarie part, euen vnto the ſaluation of his children, and
to his own glory.</p>
            <p>The Lord then in ſuch ſort, doth vſe them, as inſtruments
(though euill) that are at his commaundement, but ſo, as they can neuer be
properly called the ſeruants of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their worke is alwaies euil;
although he bringeth his good worke to paſſe by their meanes.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Theſe, as alſo their Prince, who from the beginning
was a murtherer, as far as in them lieth, doe deſire the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of
men both bodie and ſoule.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Their operations alſo are wonderfull, when God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them power to hurt: In ſo much, that after a ſort, they may ſeeme to
worke miracles.</p>
            <p n="12">12 But if we cal thoſe miracles, which are done againſt
all order of nature, the Deuils can worke no ſuch: no, nor yet anie of the
good Angels; Becauſe, this is onlie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per power of God, which can in no
wiſe be communicated with any Creature. The miracles therefore, which ſeeme
to be wrought by Deuils, are either meere deluſions, or els, wrought by the
ſecret operation of nature, (which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known vnto them, being euill
Spirits, then to any men) and therefore, they haue but the ſhew of
miracles.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Theſe euill Angels alſo, ſeeme to foretell thinges
to come: in which reſpecte, they haue long ſince, bewitched men, and
depraued the true worſhip of God, as farre as in <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1885:21"/> them
lay. But to ſpeake properlie; they cannot foretel any thing to come,
becauſe, this alſo is the peculiar worke of God onely.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Nowe, howe they are able to worke in the hearts of men,
and to ſturre vp their thoughts, that is; whether they alwaies do the ſame,
by the meanes of ſome thing laied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man, or without anie object, wee
thinke it to be a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious queſtion, and it may be ſuch, as men cannot
diſſolue. But our part is, that wee bee very carefull to enarme our
ſelues againſt theſe temptations, with all our might, by continuall
praiers.</p>
            <p n="15">15 But we affirme out of the word of God, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils

            <p>We doe therefore condemne the MANICHAES, and the PRISCILLIANISTS,

            <head>PRINCIPLES CONCERNING MAN. XII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 SEing that man is the moſt excellent of all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
workes of God: for whoſe cauſe next vnto Gods, all other things were
created: we holde it a matter belonging vnto a Diuine, to entreat of the nature
of Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Man is neither the bodie, nor the ſoule, ſeuerallie
conſidered, but compoſed of both, that is, of ſoule and bodie joined
together by a moſt ſtraight, and moſt louing band.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The truth of Gods worde doeth witnes, that there was but one
man created at the firſt, who was to bee the originall of all other men. And
ſo, all thoſe that proceded from him, ſhould be tyed together by a common
bond of blood. Wee doe then reject the opinion of ſuch Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, as
haue denied, one certaine man to haue had his beginning firſt of all
other.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The bodie of that firſt man, was formed by God of the
duſt of the earth: that is, as wee interprete it, of the foure elements: that
it ſhould not be a graue of the ſoule, as PLATO thought, but a moſt
excellent and a moſt meete inſtrument to performe the faculties of the
minde.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Now in reſpect that this bodie was made of qualities
repugnant one to the other, it was mortall in the firſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it, (for
repugnancie or diſcord, is the authour of diſſolution:) yet by the
appointment of God, it was made immortall, that it ſhould be the habitation
of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſoule: but after the entrance of ſinne into the worlde,
it returned vnto the former neceſsitie of mortality.</p>
            <p>The PELAGIANS therefore do erre, in holding that the bodies of men,
were naturallie ſubject vnto death: and in attributing the cauſe of death,
to be onely the diſcord of the contrary qualities.</p>
            <p>Other points that belong vnto the frame and beautie of mans body, we
leaue to be diſcuſſed by naturall Philoſophers and phiſitians. As
alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <pb n="31" facs="tcp:1885:22"/> things that they teach concerning the powers
of the ſoule: becaus we think it meet that we containe our ſelues within
the bonds of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. And now we will ſpeak of the eſſence of the
ſoule.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The eſſence of the ſoule can ſcarce be knowne: for
it is not to bee perceaued by the inſtrument of any the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our
bodies: yet by the faculties and operations of it, it doth in a ſort open it
ſelfe vnto vs. And therefore it is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuallie deſcribed and pointed out,
after this plaine maner.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The ſoule of man is an eſſence, created according
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the image of God, infuſed into the bodie: that man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting both
of bodie and ſoule, ſhould be capable to know and glorifie God.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The ſoule of man is properlie &amp; trulie called a
ſoule, for that facultie which is in beaſts and plants, is by reaſon of
the ſcarcity of words ſo called of the Latines. For ſeeing the ſame
doth not ſubſiſt of it ſelf, &amp; that it is nothing els, but a power
aryſing out of the properties of the matter &amp; forme; it ſcant retaineth
the name of a being, much leſſe deſerueth to be called a ſoule.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The ſoule of man is of a ſpirituall and not of a bodily
nature, ſubſiſting by it ſelfe: not vnaduiſedlie made of moates, not
a fire, or anie other of the foure elementes, or yet anie thing compact of the
elementes, not any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, not an harmony, not any facultie brought forth out
of the matter: brieflie, not anie part, cut as it were, out of the Deitie: but
wiſelie created of nothing after a manner vnknowne vnto vs, by God who
woorketh moſt freely.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Now although it hath a beginning, yet doeth it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
immortal, not onlie becauſe of it owne ſubſtance, it is vncompounded, and
voide of al contrarieties and bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie accidents: but eſpeciallie in aſmuch
as it is ſo created of God, that of it ſelfe, it can liue, exiſt, and
continue for euer. And it doth rather afforde life vnto the bodie, than deriue
it from the ſame. The which wee doe beleeue, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is proued
vnto vs by the moſt ſure teſtimonies of the holy ſcriptures, rather
then becauſe it is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by philoſophicall reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1885:23"/>Wee condemne therefore, the MANICHAEES,
GNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STICKES, and PRISCILLIANISTS, who haue ſaid that the ſoule was of a
double nature, whereof the one was from a good beginning, vz. a good God. The
other from an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. The SELEVCIANES, HERMINIANES, PROCLIANES, who held that
the ſoule was not made by God, but by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. The LVCIFERIANES and
TERTVLLIANISTS, who were of opinion, that it was a bodilie ſubſtance, and
ſuch as could fall off, or be ſhelled from the bodie, and remooue from one
bodie to an other. The ARABIANES, and the NAZARITES who thought it mortall: the
ORIGENISTS, who judged that all ſoules ſhoulde aeternallye liue in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and the APOLLINARISTS, whoſe opinion was, that one ſoule was begotten of
another.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Neither is the ſoule of the ſame nature and ſort,
that the Angels are, as ORIGEN thought: who made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie an accidentall and not
a ſubſtantiall difference between Angels, and the ſoules of men. Now,
that eſſentiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence although it cannot be eaſilie knowne, is yet
in ſome ſort perceaued by this adjunct, vz. that Angels can not be
ordinarilie joined vnto bodies, wheras the ſoules may. Now the ſoule is
alſo not onelie the firſt mouer of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but euen the verie cheef and
eſpeciall forme of a man, whereby firſt of all and of it ſelfe, A man is
that which hee is, and for whoſe cauſe, the bodie is ſo framed as it is:
to the ende, that a moſt honorable lodging ſhould be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a moſt
honorable ghueſt.</p>
            <p n="12">12 The ſoules of all men are not one as THEMISTIVS and the
followers of AVERROIS thought, but of euerie particuler man, there is a
perticular ſoule, which can (as naked and bare formes) conſiſt and
remaine, when they are ſeuered from the bodie, as in deed they do for a time,
when as they being out of the bodie, do expect the aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and

            <p n="13">13 And ſeing that the form of euerie thing, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

ſeeing when the ſame departeth, it ceaſeth from doing: wee do defend that
common opinion out of AVGVSTINE, vz. that the ſoule is whollie in the whole,
and whollie in euery part. Although there be this diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the being of

               <p>HAVING SET DOWN WHAT WE ARE to beleeue according vnto the

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 GOD alone is a moſt ſimple, and a moſt meere beeing.
And therefore, although the eſſence of the ſoule be a ſpirituall and no
bodilie ſubſtance, yet it is endued with faculties agreeable vnto the
nature of it, which, by their owne ſpirituall manner are inhaerent in the
eſſence thereof, as in their ſubject.</p>
            <p>We do not therefore allow the opinion of the PERIPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TETICKS, who
taught that the faculties of the ſoule, doth not differ from the eſſence
of it in deed, but after a ſort.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And although the very eſſence and ſubſtance of the
ſoule, doeth by the grace of God, continue without all change and alteration:
yet the powers thereof, were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a changeable nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now as man was created in one of his parts like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all
other liuing creatures, aſwell in regarde of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their
bodies, as of their naturall life, (though in a far more excellent ſtate.) So
it behoued, that that other part of his, ſhould bee endued with faculties
meet for the <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1885:24"/> preſeruation of the naturall life of his
ſaid bodie, namely; with the faculties of nouriſhing, and the power of
outward ſenſes: whereof, whatſoeuer might be farther ſpoken, wee leaue
vnto Phiſitians and naturall Philoſophers.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The other faculties are proper vnto the ſoule of man, for
the ſpirituall and immortall excellencie whereof, it is alſo (and not only
for the very eſſence of the ſoule) trulie ſaid to be created according

            <p n="5">5 Yet in aſmuch as the ſoule, in bringing forth the

bodie, whereunto it is perſonallie vnited: in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect alſo, man
(wholie conſidered but not in part) may be truly held to be created after the
image of God.</p>
            <p>We do condemne therfore the dotage of the ANTHRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POMORPHITES, who
placing the image of God in the very bodie of man, did therefore dreame, that
God was a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie ſubſtance: as alſo the madnes of OSIANDER, who
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the ſame vnto the incarnation of the world.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Theſe faculties we holde to bee two, the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
(which is alſo called the minde) and the will, or as ſometimes they are
called in the holie Scriptures, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and the ſoule taken in a more

            <p n="7">7 This Image conſidered, theſe two faculties is
expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of PAVL, by the names of righteouſnes and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
whereby hee declareth the agreement which it had with the patterne, according
vnto which it was created: A wonderfull light being powred into the facultie of
vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whereby it was endued with a moſt cleare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (and
ſuch as was obſcured by no darknes,) of the true God, and his diuine will:
And an inward force being ingraffed into the will, whereby it was able to
ſtirre vp it ſelf by holy motions, without all ſhew of reſiſtance
vnto that end, for the which man was created: the bodie, to be ſhort, beeing
framed in a moſt wonderfull decent ſort, to yeeld obedience moſt redily,
and without all weariſomnes vnto the ſoule when it moued the ſame.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Vnto this agreeablenes of man with God, and to the agreement
and proportion that all the partes of man, <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1885:24"/> had among them

            <p n="2">2 Yet of this high and ſoueraigne authority, there were
certaine lineaments ſhadowed in Angels and men, at their firſt creation,
when as both the one and other were endued by the Lord with vnderſtanding
&amp; will, whereby they were made capable of knowledge and
vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p n="3">3 For man is not onlie ſtirred to deſire by a naturall
&amp; <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1885:25"/> liuelie motion, but euen according vnto aduiſe or
electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which cannot be, without either the true, or the apparant knowledge
of the thing it deſireth.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Such furthermore, was the ſtate of the firſt man,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſinne, that his vnderſtanding and will, did altogether agree with
the wil of God, and were wholly ſubject (which is the cheefeſt libertie)
vnto his commandement, without all reſiſtance or ſtrife that the
affections had againſt the minde.</p>
            <p n="5">5 At that time therefore, man was in deed the Lord of his owne
actions, that is, endued with free-will. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was mutable and
changeable both wayes, he did ſo encline from good to euill, that as
AVGVSTINE ſaieth, by ſinning he loſt both him-ſelf, and his
libertie.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Not that hee was turned vnto a ſtock, and ſo berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of judgement and will. For ſinne hath not vtterlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed nature,
although it hath lamentablie polluted the ſame: but ſuch a libertie
remaineth, as can will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what is euill, and that euillie, For
whatſoeuer is done without faith, is ſinne.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now in things that are ſubject vnto vs, as many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
both naturall and morall are: free choiſe is left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man, that he can
either will or not will, as he hath will either to ſpeake or to hold his
peace, to ſtudie or not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But in ſupernaturall things, as are to know God, to loue
him, and to obey his will as we ought, we are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weake, and blinde, or
rather deade as PAVLE ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
            <p>Wee do condemne therefore the PELLAGIANS, who ſay that the force
of will remaineth in vs vnblemiſhed, and that ſinne may bee auoided by the
meere light of nature. And the PAPISTS alſo, who holde, that it is but
blemiſhed onely.</p>
            <p n="9">9 For we acknowledge as the Scripture teacheth, that wee are
nowe, our nature being corrupted, dead in ſinne, the children of wrath, and
enemies vnto God: and wee ſay, that we cannot by our owne ſtrength prepare
any way <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1885:25"/> for vs to come vnto God, but that if wee will come
vnto him, he muſt draw vs.</p>
            <p n="10">10 It muſt needs be therefore, that hee muſt firſt
rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate vs, and make vs the ſonnes of God, and new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. In which
worke, we are not co-workers with God, but meerelie ſuch as ſtand ſtill
while he worketh, that wee may be wrought vpon, and reformed by him, euen as we
were at the firſt created by him, without anye helpe of ours.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Nowe after regeneration, wee are by faith drawne from
death vnto life, and to will is preſent with vs, but ſo, as wee are
compaſſed about with manie hinderances, by reaſon of the ſtings of
ſinne and the fleſh in vs, which are not vtterlie done away: yet wee begin
to bee co-workers with God, and wee are ſo wrought vpon, as wee alſo doe
work: And we ſhall then whollie obey him, and ſtick vnto him, euen when our
full reſtitution beeing wrought, wee ſhall enjoy that bleſſed and
heauenly life.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The diſcourſe concerning voluntarie, changeable, and
immutable thinges, we thought meete to bee ſeuered from the quaeſtion of
Free-will, and placed in the doctrine of Gods prouidence.</p>

            <p n="1">1 THe eſtate wherevnto, both ADAM and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie
did fall; is contrarie vnto that integritie wherein he was created at the
firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For whereas the nature of man was then ſuch, as hee could
haue liued, according vnto the vpright and aeternall law, (which is nothing
els, but the will of God:) Sin hath brought him nowe to that paſſe, that
hee doth of a ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe diſobay the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Sinne is not a bare want or priuation of good, but a
ſwaruing from the will of God.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1885:26"/>4 And wee thinke, that it may bee thus
fitlie defined: Namely, that it is, whatſoeuer is againſt the law and will
of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5 For the force of ſinne, dooth not depend vppon the breach
of ſome humaine conſtitution; but vpon the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion of Gods will
onelie.</p>
            <p>And therfore, the definition of the Philoſophers, is moſt
vnperfect, who account ſinne to be that onely, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant vnto
reaſon. For reaſon it ſelfe, can doe nothing els, but go aſtray vntill
it be lightned by the light of God. The Libertines alſo are to bee condemned,
who make that onely to be ſinne, which a mans owne conſcience thinketh to
be ſinfull.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The ſeat or ſubject of ſinne, is the verie ſoule it
ſelfe, that is, the reaſon and the will. For the former of theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ignorant of that which it ſhould know, or els ruling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, as well in
commanding, as in forbidding, hath ſinne cleauing vnto it. And the latter,
either when it willeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, that which it ought not to will, or when it
willeth not that which it ought to be deſirous of, ſinneth: The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is
onelie the inſtrument of the ſoule in ſinning.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Some of the cauſes of ſinne, are inward; as the will,
(which before ſinne came, was in ADAM onely mutable; But after ſinne, as
well in him as in his poſteritie, was both mutable and corrupt.) Some
outwarde, as the Deuill, and the diuerſe objects, that are laied before
vs.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But as concerning the Lord, hee in no wiſe can bee thought
the Author of ſinne, who is ſo farre from turning men from himſelfe, that
hee rather ſeeketh to conuert all men vnto himſelfe, as vnto the onely true
and perfect end: Yet hee is ſaid to make them, to doe that which is
ſinfull, when he doth not reſtraine them from ſinning, the which whole
worke, is onelie to bee aſcribed vnto his wiſedome and juſtice.</p>
            <p>We do condemne then the MANICHAEES, the VELEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINIANS, the
SELEVTIANS, &amp;c. who affirmed, that ſinne proceedeth from God.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The effect and wages of ſinne is death, and that
aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1885:26"/> becauſe it is committed againſt him, who
is aeternall and infinite.</p>
            <p>That diſtinction of ſinne then into mortall and veniall, is
improper; ſaue onelie in the diuerſe reſpects of the elect and the
reprobate. For vnto the elect, all ſinnes are veniall through Chriſt: But
vnto the reprobates, there are no ſins but they are mortall. And it is
manifeſt, that the PELAGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANS doe erre, when they ſay, that death is
natural vnto the bodie.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Yet for all this, we thinke not all ſinnes to be equal,
in that ſence that the Stoicks did: But wee acknowledge certaine degrees in
them, according vnto the diuerſitie of their objects and circumſtances; yet
the originall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and guilt is alike aequall in all men: Seeing all men

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 THe principall ſorts of ſinnes are named two, vz.
Originall and Actuall; which notwithſtanding, are rather iſſuing (then

and the root; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the fruit and effect.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Originall ſinne, is ſomtimes called abſolutelie

            <p n="3">3 And it may be thus fitlie defined; namely, an infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deriued from ADAM vnto all mankind.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The ſubject wherevnto it cleaueth, is not onelie the
bodie, but euen the ſoule alſo. For whole man, euery part of him is
altogether corrupted, and the powers and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1885:27"/> as well
the ſuperiour, as the inferiour, both of bodie and ſoule are polluted:
whence it commeth, that in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and wil, all things are depraued and
peruerted, and in the reaſon it ſelfe, there is nothing but blindnes, the
ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and hatred of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Now, although the ſoule which is not taken from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
immediatlie created by God, may ſeme to be voyd of this infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and that
it ſeemeth not meet, that the ſins of the Fathers ſhould be puniſhed in

alſo were all the gifts, that were to bee beſtowed vpon the whole ofspring;
he by his ſinne loſt them, both to himſelf, and vnto all men, that
proceed from him; who are now, in that only reſpect that they are and do
reſemble the image of ADAM, hatefull vnto God.</p>
            <p>Wee doe condemne therefore, the PELLAGIANS, who held, that men were
ſinners, not by birth, but onely by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation.</p>
            <p n="6">6 In all men, (Chriſt onely excepted) there is the ſame
originall ſinne, and it hath ſpread it ſelfe alike vppon all men: Neither
are there any diuerſe ſorts of originall ſins.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts then doe erre, who do except others beſides
Chriſt, from originall ſinne, as the virgin Mary.</p>
            <p n="7">7 There are two effectes of originall ſinne: the guilt or
the offence, whereby all men (euen infants, which yet haue committed no actuall
ſinne) are made ſubject vnto Gods wrath, and both deathes; and alſo the
want and priuation of originall righteouſnes, and the inclination vnto all
ſorts of wickednes.</p>
            <p>Therfore, the ſcripture teacheth, that al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt be born
againe; euen infants and all, vnto whome for this cauſe, wee doe rightlie
maintaine againſt the ANABAPTISTS, that the ſigne of Regeneration is to be
adminiſtred: Although we make no queſtion; but that the reliques of
corruption doth ſtill remaine, and is not vtterly taken away; after
Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, whatſoeuer the Papiſts ſay to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Actuall ſinne is, when the lawe of GOD is broken in 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1885:27"/> deed: and that is two maner of waies; either when as that
which God commandeth is omitted, or that which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth is committed.
Whence thoſe two ſorts of ſinnes, vz. omitted and committed, ſprang
vppe in the Schooles. The firſt whereof, ariſeth, in that we are vnmeet to
do well: The latter, in that we are prone vnto euery euill.</p>
            <p n="9">9 There are other diſtinctions of actuall ſinne. For in
reſpect of the object; ſome are ſaid to be done againſt God; others
againſt men: And in regard of the ends, ſome reach vnto the ſoule onelie;
others vnto the body alſo.</p>
            <p>Vnto the firſt ſort, of the latter diuiſion, do appertaine all
inordinate motions, whatſoeuer they are; and euen all the euill cogitations,
euen the beginnings of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be fully framed, and though the will

            <p n="3">3 Our reſtoring againe, conſiſteth in that, that we
ſhuld be freed from ſinne and death, and alſo from all the effects of

that immortall life, which is far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and permanent.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Our deliuery from ſinne, is wrought by the abolliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and by the which, Sanctification is ſo begone in this life, as it ſhall be

            <p n="6">6 Theſe, and all other gifts which God beſtoweth vpon the

perſon, and his office.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The perſon of Ieſus Chriſt, is the Sonne of God, who
hath perſonallie vnited vnto himſelfe, the humaine nature, which he tooke
of the ſeed of DAVID: For he who is God from all aeternitie, began to be man,
when hee was concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the holie Ghoſt, and incarnate: that from the

               <p>VNTO THE FVLL VNDERSTANDING of thoſe things, which wee haue to
beleeue concerning the perſon of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſerueth to be needfull,
that wee declare how it is, that hee conſiſting of two natures, is yet but
one ſubſiſting perſon.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 THe ſecond perſon of the Deity; namly, the word; did
ſo neerelie vnite and appropriate vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the humaine nature, that
theſe two whole natures, &amp; their proprieties vnited togeather, are but
one ſubſiſting perſon, Ieſus Chriſt, true God and man: Yet ſo, as
the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main nature doth ſubſiſt in the diuine. Wherfore this vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is
called an Hypoſtolicall, or a perſonall vnion.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In Chriſt therefore, there is not one Chriſt, and
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt; that is, Chriſt God and Chriſt man: ſeeing the
perſon is onelie one, but yet there is one thing, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1885:29"/> thing, that is, a diuine and an humaine nature, ſeeing
the natures are diuers.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now, although theſe two natures be inſeperable; yet in
very deed, they remaine diſtinct, both in themſelues, and alſo in their
eſſentiall proprieties, and their actions: And therfore, the diuine nature
is ſeuerally, attributed vnto the Deitie, and is humaine vnto his
humanity.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Wherefore, neither of the natures ſeuerally conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in it ſelfe, can be ſaid to be the other. For you cannot truly ſay, that
the Deitie of Chriſt, is his humanity; or that his humanity is his
Deitie.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Neither can the eſſentiall proprieties of the one
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be more attributed vnto the other ſeuerally conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then the
one nature can bee ſaid to be the other. For this is no true aſſertion,
to ſay, that the Deitie was created, is finite; and contained within a place:
Nor yet this; The humanitie is without beginning, infinite, and
immeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or vncircumſcribed in a place; or that it can bee in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places at once, or euery where, or yet any where indeed, any otherwaies, then
as in a place.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Yet as they are joyned togeather, that is, in reſpect of
the whole, wholie conſidered; the word is trulie ſaid to be this man, and
this man to bee the worde; not that the one nature is transfuſed, or turned
into the other; but becauſe, theſe two natures are one only
ſubſiſting perſon, which the Schoole-men call the grace of vnion, or
vniting grace.</p>
            <p n="7">7 In like manner, although the eſſentiall properties of
the one nature, be not transfuſed into the other; yet is the word ſaid to
be crucified and dead, not in it ſelf, but in the nature that was
aſſumed. In like ſort, this man is ſaide to be Eternall, Infinite,
Immeaſurable, and God himſelfe; not in it ſelfe, but in the aſſuming
nature, or the nature that tooke fleſh.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The maner of ſpeaking, is called the communicating of
properties, the which in reſpect of Chriſt, wholie conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; is Reall;
or both in name and in deed: but in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the natures
ſeuerallie conſidered, it is verball, or onely in name.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1885:29"/>9 The Deitie of Chriſt, borroweth
nothing of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie which it aſſumed: Whereas on the other ſide,
the humanitie ſubſiſting in the Deitie, is perfected by it.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Nowe the humanitie of Chriſt, is fullie indued with ſo

            <argument>
               <p>SEING THAT WE HAVE DONE ALREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with the perſon of Chriſt,
it followeth now that we deale with his office. For theſe two are to be
conſidered in him.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 MAnkinde by reaſon of ſinne whereunto it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
fell, was altogeather loſte: in ſuch ſort as <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1885:30"/> it
could in no wiſe by it owne ſtrength eſcape aeternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But God, to the end that hee might affoorde a moſte cleare
teſtimonie of his mercie, did appoint in his aeternal counſell, to deliuer
men from this miſerie and calamitye. And to the end that this might bee done
without anie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of his juſtice, he appointed a Mediatour, who
ſhould performe all theſe things that were required.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Therfore, ſeeing to auoide the curſe of the lawe, the
lawe it ſelfe muſt bee fulfilled by men, and this can by no meanes be
performed by them: it behooued the Mediator to effect this worke, and not to
ouerpaſſe the very leaſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Gods Law.</p>
            <p>The opinion of the PAPISTS therefore is very wicked, in attributing
anie other merite vnto any man, ſaue onely the merite of Chriſts alone
obedience.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Furthermore, ſeeing it behoued God which is moſte
juſt, to puniſhe the ſinnes of men, that by this meanes his juſtice
might be fulfilled: and men could not vndergo the weight of Gods anger, but
they ſhould bee euerlaſtinglie ſwallowed vp thereby: It was the office of
the Mediatour, ſeeing he bare the perſon of all men, to pay all their
debts, and to ſuffer puniſhment for them all.</p>
            <p>They are againe moſt wicked, who bring in any other Mediatour of
ſatisfaction in the preſence of God, ſaue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie this one.</p>
            <p n="5">5 And as Chriſt was vnder the law repreſented by
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Kings and Prieſts: ſo beeing exhibited in his time, hee was
annointed to bee a King, Prieſt and Prophet. In which three callings, his
whole office is contained.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The Propheticall office of Chriſt is, to teach men the
will of God, and clearelie to lay open vnto them his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree concerning the
ſaluation of mankinde, and ſo to put an end vnto al propheſies: that is,
to fulfill all thoſe things that were fore-tolde of him.</p>
            <p>It is execrable wickednes therefore, to burden the conſcience of
man, with new commandements added vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worde, or to impoſe anie lawe
vpon the conſcience: <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1885:30"/> and much more to adjoine vnto the
Goſpell, new ſupplies of ſaluation.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The Kingdome of Chriſt conſiſteth heerein, namely,
that al his enemies beeing ſubdued vnder him, as Sathan, ſinne and death;
he onelie may beare rule ouer his church, defend the ſame, and beſtowe all
thinges needfull there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon.</p>
            <p n="8">8 This Kingdome is not like vnto other Kingdomes that are
earthlie, but it is ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Iewes are worthelie condemned, with all others,
that thinke this kingdome, to conſiſt in a kinde of outward pompe,
majeſtie and magnificence: And they are much more impudent then the Iewes
themſelues, who will haue the tyrannie of the Romane Praelate, to bee a
viſible repreſentation of Chriſts kingdome.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The office of Chriſts Preiſt-hood was, by ſome
accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sacrifice to pacifie God being offended with vs: And becauſe no
other Sacrifice, could bee found meet, and no other Prieſt worthie for this
worke: hee who was without all ſpot, became both the Sacrifice and the
Preiſt, now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo making interceſsion for vs in heauen.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Papiſticall Sacrifizing Preiſts, are moſt

they offer Chriſt really, both for the quick and the dead.</p>

XXIII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 THe efficient cauſe of faith indeede, and to ſpeake
properlie is one; to wit, the mercie of God; that is, if the Father in the
Sonne, by the holie Ghoſt, that the ſame Coeſſentiall power of the
Father and the Sonne, by the which man at the firſt was created in the image
of God ſhould reſtore in vs the ſame being left.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ordinary meanes whereby the ſame is wrought, (that is,
wherby both the vnderſtanding of man, is framed vnto a ſauing knowledge of
God in Chriſt, and a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar receauing thereof; and alſo the will
powerfullie diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto a right order of the affections) is the
preaching of Gods worde, deliuered vnto vs be the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and
for that cauſe, (ſo farre as it concerneth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) appointed to be in
the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But here two extremities are to be taken heed vnto: the on
of the ENTHYSIASTES, who do not only diſtinguiſh <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1885:32"/> but
alſo ſeparate the internall word as they call it: that is, the worke of the
Spirite of God in our ſoules, from the preaching of the written word: whence
followeth not any faith, but rather a meere dotage. The other is of thoſe,
who after the manner of Sorcerers, do transfer the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie, which is the
proper and incommunicable worke of God onlie, either vnto the miniſters which
ſpeake, or to the Sacramentall elements: wheras notwithſtanding, they haue
no other effect, then to repreſent theſe things to our vnderſtanding,
which, according vnto Gods ordinaunce they are appointed to ſignifie.</p>
            <p>Wheras then the miniſters are ſaid to worke together with God,
it is ſo to bee taken, as they are vſed, but for the outward planting &amp;
watering: when as in the mean time, the whole force which worketh in the
vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the will, doth flow from God only.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Now that which we haue ſpoken of the Eccleſiaſtical
miniſterie, is ſo to be taken, as in the meane time wee are to know, that
God as often as it pleaſeth him, is able in a moment by the inward operation
of his Spirit, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to regenerate his elect.</p>
            <p n="5">5 But this extraordinarie worke of God, is neither to be
expected for of vs, nor yet raſhlie to be admitted.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Now the moſt ſure way to try it, whether it be trulie
from God, or no; is this: namelie, that whether it be by the ordinarie hearing
of the word: or, (which hath beene alwaies moſt ſeeldom) whether God
worketh by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie inſpiration; it muſt needes euermore teach the
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſame doctrine, which the written word of the Prophets and the
Apoſtles do teach.</p>
            <p n="7">7 There is not at all times the like majeſty of the good
order of this ſacred Miniſterie, becauſe the Lord doeth as often, and as
farre as hee thinketh good, reuenge the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligencie and wickednes of the
Sheep-heards, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the ſheepe in ſuch ſort: that
ſometimes it is dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by ſpots of filthineſſe: and otherwhiles for
a time, it goeth as it were, cleane out of ſight, as it came to paſſe in
the former ages.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1885:32"/>8 Yet the Militant Church, either priuate
or publicke from others, or by means of priuate reading, hath euer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
and euer ſhall enjoy the hearing of the worde, and the vnderſtanding of the
trueth that ariſeth therefrom.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Nowe that true and liuely faith, whereof wee ſpeake, is no
leſſe made knowen, by the perpetuall and neceſſarie effects thereof,
then is the life of the bodie, by motion and ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="10">10 But theſe effects doe not giue beeing vnto faith, or
informe the ſame, as the Sophiſters doe moſt abſurdlie dreame, but they
are the vndoubted and ſure ſignes of it.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Theſe effects are partly caried out of vs vnto Chriſt,
with whome we are vnited by faith, and partly they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſome things
within vs.</p>
            <p n="12">12 The outward effects, in aſmuch as they doe peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
apply Chriſt and his benefits, vnto thoſe that beleeue, are therefore the
moſt excellent, and of greateſt account. And they are, both the full
remiſsion of all ſinnes, as well originall as actuall, by the blood of
Chriſt; and alſo, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing vpon vs, of all righteouſnes fulfilled
by him, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the moſt full reſtoring and repairing of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

imputed vnto vs, who take holde both of him and his gifts.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Another effect of our ſpirituall joyning togeather with
him by faith, is; that he gouerneth by his holy Spirit, both our

XXIIII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 THat we may haue a ſure foundation of aeternall life, and
may worſhip God in this life with a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et conſcience; the doctrine of mans
juſtification in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, is very neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Iuſtification therefore, is a free imputation of
righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, made of God, by and for Chriſt, to ſaluation vnto euery
one that beleeueth.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But in aſmuch as God is exceedingly mercifull, and
exceedinglie juſt, and that his mercie doth not aboliſh his juſtice,
which remaineth vnviolated; it behooued, that his juſtice ſhuld be fullie
ſatisfied, before ſuch time as he could poure forth his mercie vpon
mankind, and therefore that Chriſt ſhould be God and man.</p>
            <p n="4">4 For he who is onelie man, cannot be able to ſuſtaine the
wrath of God; nor on the other ſide, hee who is onelie God, becauſe, that
God can bee ſubject vnto no kinde of ſuffering.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Therefore God the Father, beeing drawen in mercie, woulde
haue his onelye begotten Sonne, at the appointed time, to become true man,
without any confuſion or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of the natures, might reconcile men vnto
God.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The efficient cauſe therefore, of the righteouſnes
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto vs, is the mercie of God the Father, and his free loue towards
vs: for he it is that ſaueth and juſtifieth.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The materiall cauſe, is Chriſt crucified, and riſen
for vs, where three thinges come to bee conſidered: the one whereof,
conſiſteth in the puniſhments, whereby hee hath moſt fullie ſatisfied
for all our ſinnes: The other ſtandeth in his obedience, &amp; the
fulfilling of the whole lawe, by him for vs: the third, is the moſt perfect
repairing, and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our nature in the fleſh, which Chriſt tooke
vpon him; wherby the filthines of our nature is couered, that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not
into the ſight of God.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:1885:33"/>8 The formall cauſe, is the verie
imputation of Chriſts righteouſnes, by meanes whereof, we are accounted to
be freed from ſinne, juſt, holie, and heires of aeternall life.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The inſtrumentall is of two ſortes, the one in reſpect
of God that juſtifieth, which is Chriſt himſelfe; the other in reſpect
of vs, that lay holde vpon imputation of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; and the ſame is
faith, imbracing firmely the promiſes of the grace of God in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="10">10 The finall likewiſe is two-folde; the one in reſpect
of GOD, and that is, that hee might declare his righteouſnes vnto men, by
partaking the ſame with them, and alſo the glorye of his name, the which
hee maketh more cleare in the veſſels of mercie: the other in reſpect of
vs, that wee may at the length, enjoy indeed that life, which is laied vp for
vs in the Heauens, which now we poſſeſſe by hope one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The effect inhaerent in vs, as in a ſubject, is that
newe qualitie, which is called inhaerent righteouſnes, or regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which in no wiſe doth abſolue vs in the preſence of God; but is onely a
moſt ſure witnes of our engraffing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and therefore, of our
free abſolution in him.</p>
            <p n="12">12 This righteouſnes, ſeeing it cannot bee giuen vnto
anie, ſaue onely vnto the elect by faith, hath annexed vnto it, the gift of
perſeuerance; although by their fault, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſometimes to be
ceaſed.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Whence we gather, that they, who haue bene once endued by
God with this righteouſnes, can neuer fal away from his grace, and as for
them that ſhall neuer bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers heereof, they ſhall periſh for

the ſubduing of that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall corruption of ours, which was imputed vnto
him: <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1885:34"/> whence it commeth to paſſe, that wee deuide our
whole ſanctification into theſe three members; mortification, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of
the old man, and the riſing againe of the new.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The mortification of the olde man, wee call the effect of
that ſpirituall and moſt powerfull application of the death of Chriſt,
wherby our corruption, receaueth a deaths wound; ſo that it is no more ſo
powerful, to ſtirre vp in our minds, wicked motions, &amp; ſuch as are
contrary vnto Gods will.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The burying of the olde man, is alſo an effect of the
ſpirituall application of Chriſts buriall, whereby, our olde man, being
alreadie wounded by that deadly ſtroke, dieth by little and little, vntill at
the length, after the death of this bodie, it be brought to nothing: For as the
buriall of the bodie, is a going forward of death; ſo alſo, the burying of
the olde man, is nothing els, but a continuance, ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding further
and further, of that mortification which went before.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The raiſing againe of the new man, is alſo an effect of
the ſpiritual aplication of the reſurrection of Chriſt; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it
commeth to paſſe, that the new man is raiſed vp in vs, that is, that the
qualities of our minde (to wit, our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and will) are renued vnto
true holines of life.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Theſe being renued by faith, powred into vs, though all
the time of our being heere; we doe but in a ſort vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and will the
thinges that are of God: yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, our workes which belong vnto
Gods ſeruice, are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourablie accepted by his Majeſtie, as proceeding from
Chriſt, liuing and working in vs by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9 In this reſpect then, we make this difference, between
Philoſophicall and Chriſtian vertues, that the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a
minde, not yet regenerated; are no other, then filthie and impure, in the
preſence of God; whereas, the latter on the other ſide, doe of fauour
pleaſe God, and are in mercie crowned by him, becauſe, hee looketh vppon
them as fruits of faith, flowing from Chriſt, who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of all our
purity and holines.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Out of theſe thinges which haue bene ſpoken, may 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1885:35"/> be vnderſtood, not onely al the parts of our
ſanctification, but euen the cauſes which concurre for the making vppe
thereof, may bee ſo eaſilie gathered; as it may be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, that we
put the holy Ghoſt for the efficient, fayth for the inſtrumentall, the
force and efficacie of that eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall holines which is in Chriſt for
the materiall, the renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our whole minde, from impure, vnto pure and
vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right qualities for the formall; and the worſhippe of God tending vnto his
honor and the loue of our neighbour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the preſcript rule of
the firſt and ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for the finall cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Whence it apeareth, that the Libertins who loath the
practiſe of good workes, are not to be reckoned vp amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the number of
true Chriſtians; ſeeing they neglect the chiefe end of a Chriſtian life.
It appeareth alſo, that the PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAGYANS, and the halfe PELLAGIANS the PAPISTS,
are to bee deteſted, becauſe, the former of them doe affirme, that we are
ſanctified by nature onely: the latter, partly by nature, and partly by
grace.</p>

            <head>PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE IV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIFICATION OF SINFVLL MAN IN THE
PRESENCE OF GOD. XXVI</head>
            <p n="1">1 IN aſmuch as, our whole ſaluation conſiſteth in our
juſtification before GOD; it is needfull, that wee maintaine the true
doctrine thereof, againſt al the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame; if ſo bee that
wee will obtaine ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This juſtification then is, when God doth attribute the
ſanctification of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, performed for mankind, vnto
thoſe that beleeue in him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 For whereas God is exceedinglie merciful, and exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie
juſt; his mercie indeed, did deſire the redemption of man, but his
juſtice demaunded an abſolute, and euery way a perfect ſatisfaction for
the ſame.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:1885:35"/>4 To the end therfore, that the Lord might
beſtow his mercie vpon vs; it was needful that his juſtice ſhould be
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Now the moſt ſeuere juſtice of God, could not be
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, either by him, who ſhould be onely man; (becauſe, no
Creature, no not the Angels themſelues, can ſo ſuſtaine the waight of
Gods anger, as they may be deliuered ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; much leſſe deliuer others:)
or yet by him, who ſhuld be onelie God, becauſe the Deitie cannot bee
ſubject vnto any ſufferings.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Therefore God the Father, mooued by his vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
mercie, would haue that onelie Sonne of his, Coeſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and Coaeternal
with him (as he had promiſed vnto the Fathers, when Sin firſt entered into
the world) at the time appointed, to become true man, who, as beeing true God
and true man, without any confuſion of the two natures, might reconcile men
with God.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Of the juſtice of this Mediatour, the which juſtice is
laied againſt thoſe thinges, that make vs guiltie of Gods wrath, there are
three parts. The one is, the penalty ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the ſatisfaction of
all our ſinnes, which hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged to the verie vttermoſt farthing.
The other is, the abſolute fulfilling of the whole lawe of GOD, thereby
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering our whole guiltines, both that which wee haue by our originall
blemiſhe, or by ſinning ſinne, and alſo by the ſins that ar the
moſt bitter fruits of that root. The third is, the repairing of our humaine
nature, in that moſt perfect humanitie, which Chriſt tooke vpon him;
whereby all our corruptions and ſtaines are blotted out.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The righteouſnes of Chriſt profiteth vs nothing,
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be made ours.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Now it becommeth ours, not by any infuſion, either
Eſſentiall, as OSIANDER dreamed, or qualitatiue, as the jangling
Sophiſters doe auouch; but by a ſpirituall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion or applying of
Chriſt, effected in our mindes; after the which, followeth the free
imputation of that threefold righteouſnes, which is inhaerent in the man
Chriſt onely, as in the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:1885:36"/>10 Of this ſpirituall and moſt
effectuall apprehenſion and application, the only inward inſtrument, is
true faith, which is that full aſſurance, whereby euery one that
belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, doth imbrace particularlie, the righteouſnes of chriſt offered,
as appertaining vnto them.</p>
            <p n="11">11 This faith is in noe wiſe of our ſelues, but from the
meare grace of God, the holie Ghoſt mercifully creating the ſame in the
vnderſtanding, and the harte of the elect, that is, being the cauſe that
after they haue heard, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the worde of the Goſpell, they doe
trulie beleeue although not perfectlie: whoe alſo doth afterwarde ſeale vp
and nouriſhe this gift in them: as they doe learne more and more, by the
dailie hearing and meditation of the word of the ſaid Goſpell, and as the
Sacraments annexed vnto the worde, doe moſt effectuallie witneſſe vnto
them.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Now as the ſame Chriſt, doth reconcile them vnto his
father, and purchaſe vnto them the title of the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie inheritance, who
being freelie made partakers of that three-folde righteouſnes, doe lay hold
vpon him by faith: euen ſo, doth hee ſanctifie them by his Spirite,
abolliſhing the olde man in them by a little and a little, both kindling a
new light in their vnderſtanding, and alſo ſturring vp ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie motions in
their wils, to the end, that ſtrongly reſiſting with all their might, the
reliques of the old man; they ſhuld beginn both to will, and to doe that
which is good.</p>
            <p n="13">13 That newe qualitie then, called inhaerent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and regeneration teſtified by good workes, is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie effect of
true faith: whence it is to bee gathered, that good workes are by no meanes the
cauſes, but onelie the witneſſes of that imputed juſtification, whereby
alone tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conſciences are at reſt: for they are no otherwiſe to be
conſidered, then as things, that neceſſarilie followe the beleeuers,
being alreadie juſtified in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Therefore we are ſaid to be juſtified by faith onelie,
without any works; not that true faith is at any time alone or deſtitute of
good works; but in aſmuch as workes, how good ſo euer they be, do not
concurre or availe to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the righteouſnes of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1885:36"/>15 The ſquare and only rule of theſe
good works, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the which they are to be directed, &amp; moſt
diligent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to be waied; is the wil of God laied open to vs in the law.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Now althogh that they, who are after this maner
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled vnto God through Chriſt aprehended by faith, do daily ſin; and
though alſo, that their good works are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way perfect, but defiled by
ſinne, (whereof wee haue many remnants ſtil continuing in vs after our
renuing) yet thoſe that do beleeue, are to feare no condemnation, but may
aſſuredly wait, and looke for aeternall life; wherof they ſhalbe

            <head>PRINCIPLES CONCERNING GOOD WORKES. XXVII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 GOod workes are as neceſſary for the ſound and the
vndoubted diſcerning of true ſanctification in a regenerate man, (wherof we
haue ſpoken) as are good fruits in a tree that beareth, to ſhew that it
hath bin right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie graffed.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We call good works, the effects of thoſe actions one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
which in the regenerat by the working of the Spirite of God through faith, are
ſquared according vnto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript rule of Gods law, that in them God
might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and our neighbours helped.</p>
            <p n="3">3 There are foure thinges then to be eſpeciallie obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in this definition; the holy Ghoſt, as the efficient cauſe, Faith the
inſtrumentall, the law of God the formall, Gods glorie and the edification of
our neighbour, as the finall.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Out of theſe former parts rightlie vnderſtoode, the
whole doctrine of good workes is made cleare; and with al the falſe
doctrines, both of ancient and new writers in this argument, are out of them
eaſily confuted.</p>
            <p n="5">5 In the firſt place then, to ſpeak of the efficient
cauſe; we affirme, that we are enabled to doe good workes, onely by the grace
and aſsiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, renuing our harts, when as it doth
incline our vnderſtanding, our wil, &amp; all our members, which are turned
from God, in ſuch ſort, as we do obey the knowen will of God: for the
worketh in vs both to will and to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1885:37"/>The PAPISTS then are deceaued, who leaning vpon
their owne ſtrength, do brag of their free-will, and their naturall
abilities, as if it laye in them to preuent or go before the firſt grace, by
a kinde of Praeparation: and as though of themſelues they could in a ſort
bring foorth good workes.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Secondly, as faith cannot be without good workes, ſo good
workes can not be, where there is no faith.</p>
            <p>Whereupon we condemne their errour, who boldlie auouch that good
workes were, or coulde bee done by profane men, or ſuch, as were not endued
with faith, howe juſt and wiſe ſoeuer they were accounted: ſeeing
whatſoeuer is done without faith, is ſinne.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Although wee profeſſe that good works are no leſſe
neceſſarily conjoined with faith, then light with the Sunne, or heat with
the fire: yet do we not ſay that they are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſpected of God, as
though by them we deſerued; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee juſtified before him, or to bee
made his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p n="8">8 And they are to be accounted to deale no leſſe
impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie then raſhlie and ignorantlie, who raiſe vp the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that
we contemne and reject good workes, becauſe we hold that men are juſtified
by faith onlie.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Thridlie, ſeeing the Law of God is the cauſe which
giueth the forme vnto good workes, (that is, the name of true goodnes) we
auouch that none of thoſe things which haue no other ground then the bare
will or reaſon of man can be reckened among good workes.</p>
            <p n="10">10 In like manner, that a man may bee ſaid to do well it is
not ſufficient, that what he doth be found to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Law of
God: but this alſo is required, that he aſſuredlie know, that what hee
doth bee enjoined vnto him by the Lord, and that he doe it with an intent to
obey God therein: For whatſoeuer is done with a doubtfull conſcience, is
ſinne.</p>
            <p n="11">11 And although the good works of the regenerate be not
perfect, becauſe, we cannot in this life, (no not though we be aſsiſted
by the holie Ghoſt) liue according vnto the <pb n="62" facs="tcp:1885:38"/> preſcript
of Gods law; but rather our good works are ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with manie blemiſhes:
yet they do pleaſe God; not for any worthines of theirs, but partly becauſe
our defects are couered, by the holines, merites and interceſsion of
chriſt, and partly becauſe GOD, dooth of fauour, approoue and crowne them,
not as they are in them ſelues, but as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Spirite in vs, and
witneſſes of our faith.</p>
            <p>Whence wee gather, that the DONATISTS, PELLAGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANS, PHARISIES,
ANABAPTISTS, MONKS, and the reſt of that batch are to bee condemned, who brag
of a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of life and obedience, and doe ſecurelie reſt
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their own workes, as though they were in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie point
anſwerable vnto the law of God.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Laſtly, although we haue ſaid, that the ends of good
workes, are the glorie of God, and the aedification of our neighbours; yet doth
it not therefore follow, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ereby other ends of greateſt moment be excluded; of which ſort,
are the teſtimonie of a good conſcience, the ſure token of true Religion
or Chriſtian faith, the aſſurance of our aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall election, the
auoyding of the puniſhment due vnto euill workes, and the vndeſerued
obtaining of the good works.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we may juſtlie accuſe all Atheiſts, Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
quarrellers with the law, as though it were repugnant vnto it ſelf;
Hypocrits, Libertines, and impenitent perſons, as guilty of impietie; who
either do deſpiſe good works as being vnprofitable, or condemne them as
burdenſom vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the conſcience.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Neither is it to bee concluded, in aſmuch as in this
mater, we make mention of rewards, as the ſcripture doth, that therefore,
they are by merite due vnto good workes: For whatſoeuer wee doe or can
woorke, the ſame are wee bound to doe; and although wee had doone all, yet
muſt wee confeſſe our ſelues to be vnprofitable ſeruants.</p>
            <p>We doe againe heere abhorre, the MANICHAEES, PEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAGIANS,
Phariſies and Papiſts, who euery hand while, thruſting vpon vs that
prodigious dreame of their own, concerning the merits of good workes doe
thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1885:38"/> and diminiſh the onlie merit of the
ſatisfaction of Chriſt.</p>

            <head>PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE LAW OF GOD. XXVIII.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>SEING WE HAVE ALREADIE SPOKEN of good works: it now followeth,
that we deale with the rule thereof, that is with the law of God.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 THe lawe of God, is the manifeſtation and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of
his will, publiſhed by himſelfe, whereby is deſcribed, both the true
inward worſhip of God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo all the duties of man towards man.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This lawe is deuided into three partes, Morall,
Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, and politicke or judiciall.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Morall law is that, which preſcribeth the rule of
Godly and vpright life, in the preſence of God, the which rule is onelie the
will of the law-giuer alone, and it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into two Tables: The former
whereof, is concerning God: The latter is touching our neighbour; the former is
comprehended in four commandements moſt orderlie ſet down; and the latter
in ſix: whence it ariſeth, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commandements are ten in
number.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The Ceremoniall law, was as it were, a certaine pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or
ſhape, (exhibited vnto the outwarde ſenſes) of the inward worſhip of
God: the which portion of the law, part lie (as far as it was adjoyned vnto the
Morall) teſtified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, what in themſelues they deſerued: namely,
aeternal death and damnation; and partly (as far to wit, as it reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the
Euangellicall promiſes of Chriſt, that was to com) did ſhadow our full
deliuerance in Chriſt, from that miſery and calamitie.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The Iudiciall or Politicall lawe, was the doctrine of
thoſe externall actions, whereby the ciuill Common-welth of the Iewes was to
be gouerned.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:1885:39"/>6 The Morall law may be alſo rightly
called the law of nature; becauſe that God had ingraued the ſame at the
firſt creation in the mindes of men, in ſuch ſort, as men ſhould haue
bene borne endued with the full knowledge thereof; if ſin had not for the
moſt part darkened the ſame in them.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now, becauſe it was ſo growen out of vſe by reaſon
of ſinne, as in a manner, it ſeemed to bee altogeather blotted out:
Therefore, the Lorde thought good to publiſh, renue, and giue the ſame in
writing vnto his people, that they might not haue any excuſe of their
ignorance.</p>
            <p n="8">8 It was in this ſorte renued, firſt of al, to the end
that compelling men (by the ſight of the repugnancie, which is betwene that
diuine rule of juſtice, and our own affections &amp; behauior) to acknowledg
the corruption that is in them; and the fruit thereof, it might pronounce them
worthie of aeternall damnation.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Next, that finding them guiltie of condemnation, it might by
accident drawe them to ſeeke remedy els-where, namelie, by the preaching of

            <p n="10">10 Thirdlie, that hauing gotten the elect regenerated by the
holie Ghoſt, it might bee vnto them a teacher of true holines towardes GOD,
and charitie towardes their neighbours.</p>
            <p>The PELLAGIANS then erred moſt falſelie, who thought, that the
lawe was giuen vnto men, as though they (beeing enabled by nature to performe
the ſame) onelie ſtood in neede to be put in minde of their dutie by it: In
which error, alſo euen at this day, the halfe PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAGIANS the Papiſts doe in
a ſort continue.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Nowe whereas the lawe is ſaide by PAVLE, to make ſinne
more ſinful, to procure wrath to be the ſting of ſinne and of death, it
is to be vnderſtoode, that this is done, not by the fault of the law, but by
our corruption, even as the the Goſpell is vnto ſome, the ſauour of death
vnto death, not of it ſelfe, but by accident.</p>
            <p n="12">12 The morall law, in conſideration of the Saints, that is,
of thoſe that beleeue, is abolliſhed by the comming of Chriſt, as farre
as it had power to condemne; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <pb n="65" facs="tcp:1885:39"/> Chriſt
was made a curſe for them. But it retaineth ſtill a double vſe in the
elect: namely, that it might with the feare of puniſhment, keepe vnder the
olde man, (the remnants whereof is as yet in them) and inſtruct their new man
in the wayes of the Lord. Now in reſpect of the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, it retaineth,
and will vnto the worlds end retaine, that firſt end, which is to conuince
them and condemne them without all hope of mercie: And as to the other two
profitable vſes, by their owne fault it is in no whit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable vnto
them.</p>
            <p>The Libertines therfore, the Antinimonians, and the reſt that
reject the moral Law, are execrable &amp; accurſed.</p>

touching the vſe of it, ſeeing the bodie it ſelfe which was ſhadowed by

            <p>And their error is much more to bee damned, who haue the traditions

firſt commandement of the Law.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 THe firſt words of the Lawe, are a Praeface, which dooth

of the things, that are to bee done.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Lord before hee would begin to ſet downe the

(For the ſpirite of God dealeth not with vs by the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue ſpeaches

            <p n="5">5 This Praeface doth in generall define vnto vs, who is the

ſuch ſort, as in them he ſpeaketh vnto al na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as hauing promiſed,
that all nations ſhall be bleſſed in the ſeed of Abraham.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Ther are three things to be dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly marked in euery
commandement of this Law: firſt, the perſon of the Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, then the

or forbidden to be done,</p>
            <p n="7">7 The word IEHOVA, is to be referred vnto that diuine
authoritie, which the Lord by the right of his creation and prouidence hath
ouer all creatures. For hee is thence called IEHOVA, euen becauſe hee is, and
maketh all things that are to bee, and to ſubſiſt: and withall, doeth
admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter life and ſuſtenance vnto them.</p>
            <p n="8">8 In euery one of theſe commandements, the whole is to be
vnderſtood and gathered out of the part, &amp; from the outward act, we are

            <p n="9">9 By the affirmatiue, we muſt alwaies gather the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue:
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe: to teach vs, that we are not only bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to abſtain

            <p n="10">10 The true &amp; the lawfull inward ſeruice of God, is
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciallie contained in the firſt commandement, which is nothing elſe,
but the worſhipping of the true God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the preſcript of his
Law.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The end of the firſt commandement is, that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his people will beare rule ouer all, &amp; whollie enjoy his authority. And to
the end that this may come to paſſe, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth al impiety, &amp; al

which wee owe vnto God be innumerable, yet they may bee not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properlie

ſecond is an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured truſt: the thrid is, inuocation, or prayer. The
fourth and laſt, is thankſgiuing.</p>
            <p n="13">13 The inward acknowledging, we make to be a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of
the true God, joined with the aſſent of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, reuerence, and
ſubmiſsion.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Aſſured truſt, is a ſecure reſting vpon him,
ariſing from the knowledge of his ſauing will.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Inuocation, is the betaking of our minde vnto the trueth
and promiſe of God, as vnto the only fortreſſe of our ſaluation.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Thankeſgiuing, is the profeſsion of a thankfull minde,
whereby the praiſe of all the good things that wee receaue, is yealded vnto
God, as vnto the giuer of them. Now, as God doth not ſuffer any of all
theſe things to be deriued elſe where: ſo he commandeth all of them to

            <head>PRINCIPLES VPON THE SECOND COMMANDEMENT OF GODS LAVVE.
XXX.</head>
            <p n="1">1 EVen as the acknowledging and inward worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of on
God, is eſpeciallie in the firſt comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: ſo the ſecond
commandement doth ſet down the outward worſhip of the ſame God, from the
contrary.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The end is, that all religious, worſhip, euen that which
is outward, is due vnto God onlie: and ſuch a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as is agreeable
vnto his ſpirituall nature.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:1885:41"/>3 This commandement conſiſteth of
three members: for God firſt of all forbiddeth the making of any image to
repreſent his diuine godhead. Secondly, he forbiddeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie worſhip to be
yealded vnto him, in any image. Thrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, hee bringeth a twofolde reaſon of
this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the one, becauſe hee is the onlie aeternall GOD, and
therefore can bee repreſented by no bodilie ſhape or forme: the other,
becauſe hee alone is able both to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge moſt ſeuerelie the contemners
of his name, and alſo infinitly to bleſſe his true worſhippers.</p>
            <p n="4">4 All thoſe therefore, whoſoeuer haue at any time bin, not
onely the worſhippers of Images, as of holie thinges; but euen the markes of
them to that purpoſe, are once for all condemned as ſuperſtitious in this
commandement.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Fooliſh therfore is that opinion, which the Grecians haue
nowe theſe many yeares maintained, who tolerating painted Images, doe
altogeather refuſe grauen Pictures, or any that are made of ſolide
matter.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Ridiculous alſo is their ignoraunce, who make a
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the Greeke word IDOL, and the Latin name Image.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Friuelous alſo is that three-folde diſtinction of
reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhippe, 
<note n="a" place="margin">Worſhip due vnto God.</note> LATRIA, 
<note n="b" place="margin">Seruice due vnto Idols.</note> DVLIA, and 
<note n="c" place="margin">And dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeruice due to the Virgin
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> HYPOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DVLIA, which hath beene latelie in part inuented, and in
part depraued by the Papiſts.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Neither is their euaſion to be leſſe condemned, who to
the end, they may excuſe the ſin of Idolatrie, do affirme; that they
worſhip not the Images, but that, which is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by them.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Yet wee doe not holde all Images to be forbidden in this
commandement, but ſuch as are ordained for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſake; the religious
vſe whereof, the worde of God doth therefore condemne; becauſe it is
contumelious, both vnto God and his creatures.</p>
            <p n="10">10 And ſeeing, that the Temples or Churches of
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are ordained for the vſe of Religion; it is vnlawfull to place
Images in them, which the ancient &amp; purer chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wanted, for the ſpace
of four hundred yeares, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <pb n="70" facs="tcp:1885:42"/> ſince that time,
ſtanding Images, were at the length ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to come in after painted
walles had beene admitted, &amp; togeather with the ſtanding Images, that
horrible mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Idolatrie ſuffered to take place, which cannot as yet be
thruſt out.</p>
            <p n="11">11 We grant then, that there is another manifold law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vſe of Pictures: for ſome of them were Typicall, in the old Teſtament;
yet not by man, but by Gods appointment, and not to the end, that any wiſe
they ſhould bee worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but that they might repreſent ſome diuine
thing, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhape of that which was viſible vnto the eie, as the
braſen Serpent was the figure of Chriſt, and the ſhape of the two
Cherubins, that ſat vpon the holy Arke, reſembled the Majeſtie of God,
attended vpon by his Angels.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Theſe examples doe nothing auaile them, who by this
pretence doe defend, that Images may be tolerated in the Churches of
Chriſtians; For the figure of the Serp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, was not placed in the
Tabernacle, neither was it made to the end it ſhould be preſerued; much
leſſe, that it ſhould be anie wiſe worſhipped, and it was afterward
juſtlie bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in peeces; and the Cherubins, together with the Ark it
ſelfe were ſo placed, as they were not be ſeen by thoſe that came into
the Tabernacle.</p>
            <p n="13">13 There is alſo an Hiſtoricall vſe of them, whereby
profitable ſtories drawen, either out of the Scriptures, or out of other
writers, may be laid before vs: the which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, how dangerous
they are to bee ſet vp in the places appointed for the vſe of Religion,
both the practiſe of the auntient purer Churches, and alſo the admonitions
of the writers of thoſe times doe witnes; and euen experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth teach
vs.</p>
            <p n="14">14 No man alſo, of any ſound judgement douteth, but that
ſome paintings and caruings may bee vſed for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſake, and euen in
the places appointed for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Religion; ſo that they be
ſuch, as it may appeare, that no opinion of any religious worſhipp, may any
waies ariſe thereof: Of which ſort, there were not a fewe, in the
workmanſhip of the Temple, and that among the verie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie 
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1885:42"/> veſſels themſelues.</p>
            <p n="15">15 They are alſo profitable, to come to the knowledge of
the nature of manie things; as are the pictures of beaſts, Trees, Cities, and
Countries: and that in ſuch ſort, as ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are neceſſarilie
required in the deciding of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies in ciuill judgement.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The ſtrength of God oppoſed vnto the vanitie of
I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, is mencioned 
<note n="a" place="margin">I Iehoua thy God, the ſtrong God am
jelous.</note> in this commaundement, againſt thoſe, who attribute vnto
them ſome abilitye aboue the power of men, either to hurt or to helpe.</p>
            <p n="17">17 God indeede is ſubject vnto no paſsions or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
He notwithſtanding doth here compare himſelfe vnto a jealous Husband, that
to the end we may know, that hee will haue vs to bee wholie conſecrated vnto
himſelfe; and that he can in no wiſe abide, that any beſides himſelf
ſhuld be partakers of our loue.</p>
            <p n="18">18 The Sonne indeed ſhal not beare the iniquity of the
Father; but the ſame ſoule that ſinneth ſhall die: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
ſinne is ſo odious in the ſight of God, that it is not a matter
vnbeſeeming his juſtice, to depriue the ſeed of the wicked of his grace,
the light of the truth, and all meanes of ſaluation: Yet can no man
complaine, ſeeing all men are guiltie of the curſe.</p>
            <p n="19">19 The Children of the wicked then, are depriued of the
bleſsing of God, becauſe the Lord doth take the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion therof from the
ſinnes of their wicked Parents, whoſe waies the Children do tread, and
whoſe proper ſins there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, do deſerue temporal and aeternall
puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="20">20 God doth loue righteouſnes, in ſuch ſort, as he doth
bleſſe, not onelie the Fathers themſelues, that are carefull of
righteouſnes, but euen their poſterity alſo: and that, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by
proſpering their affaires, in reſpect of the thinges of this life, or by
rewarding them with aeternall life.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Yet is it an euill concluſion, which ſome doe make, to
gather merite from the rewarde which God promiſeth vnto the obſeruers of
his law. For God doth not ſay here, that he will be faithfull and juſt; but
that he will be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full towards them.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:1885:43"/>22 It maketh nothing againſt theſe
things, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Children of the wicked, become carefull of
well-doing: and contrariwiſe, that the ſeede of the Godlie, doe degenerate;
becauſe thet Law-giuer ment not heere to ſet down an inuiolable rule which
might degenerate from his Election.</p>
            <p n="23">23 Now, whereas God doth aſsigne foure generations vnto his
wrath, and doth ſtreatch his mercie vnto a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; it is an argument,
that of his owne nature, he is more bent to ſhew mercy, then vnto
ſeueritie.</p>
            <p n="24">24 This threatning, and alſo this promiſe, doth indeed
appertaine vnto the reſt of the Commaundements; but it was eſpeciallie
annexed vnto this ſecond, that thereby wee may know, how greatlie God
deteſteth Idolatrie amongſt all other ſinnes.</p>

            <p n="1">1 THe end and the ſcoape of this third commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to
ſhew what reuerence is due vnto God in the conuerſation of mans ſocietie,
the which wee are bound to referre vnto the glorie of God, as vnto the

            <p n="2">2 Now this is ſet downe by the contraries: for the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie of that which is forbidden, is heere commaunded.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And it ſeemed to be more meet, that this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
ſhould bee vttered, rather in the forme of forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, then commanding:
bicauſe that is not alwaies neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to bee doone, which is heere

vnlawful.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The name of God here ſpoken of, is not to be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to ſome one certaine title or ſyllable; but it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth whatſoeuer
may bee ſpoken concerning God, or doth belong vnto his knowledge and
glorie.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:1885:43"/>5 In ſumme therefore, we are commanded
in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, (by ſetting downe the part for the whole) in all our
walking in this life, to haue the glorie of God before our eies; and therefore,
heere is forbidden whatſoeuer, either directlie or indirectlie, either
vnwittinglie or purpoſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth vnto his diſhonor.</p>
            <p n="6">6 To take the name of GOD, is to make mention of his name; the
which thing, the Lorde forbidding to bee done raſhly, or for a matter of
ſmal value, or vnreuerently, he dooth much more condemne, whatſoeuer is a
greater offence then raſhnes, or want of reuerence.</p>
            <p n="7">7 All abuſe therefore of Gods word, in the deluſion of

            <p n="9">9 We make an oath, to be an inuocation of God, both as a

            <p n="11">11 Iuſtice commandeth, firſt that that be juſt which is
promiſed; that is, that it bee agreeable vnto the reuealed will of God.
Secondlie, that the cauſe of the oath bee juſt.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Iudgement requireth, that an oath be demaunded, and
yeelded with great circumſpection, and that a preciſe conſideration be
had, both of the matter whereof the oath is taken, and alſo, of the perſon
that ſweareth.</p>
            <p n="13">13 A juſt cauſe of an oath is, either when the glorie of
God is called in queſtion, and ſo the greatnes of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth craue it
of vs, or when our owne ſaluation, or our neighbors doth require it, or when
ſome outward matter of great waight doth driue vs therevnto, or when the
caſe ſtandeth, that by it wee may lawfully auoyde ſome priuate 
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1885:44"/> or publicke dammage: when the aſſurance of ſome
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of great moment, or to bee ſhort: when the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate doth
craue a lawfull oath at our hands in a juſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="14">14 An oth taken, either to perform thoſe things, which God,
and the publicke lawes that are good doth forbid, or to leaue vndone thoſe
things, which we owe vnto God and our neighbour, either by reaſon of our
generall or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular calling, both priuate and publicke, is not to be
ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled: Yet is not hee to be excuſed before GOD and his Church, which
taketh ſuch an oath.</p>
            <p n="15">15 An oath yeelded by them, that are not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,
whether they doe well or not, as by one that is mad or phranticke, by a childe:
or by thoſe that haue no power to binde them ſelues; as by Pupilles and
Wardes, or thoſe that are at the gouernement of their Parents or Maiſters,
and generallie by any, that are not at their owne hand and ordering, or an oth
that is taken concerning a matter that lieth not in the power of him that
ſweareth, as concerning other mens goods, or the keeping of perpetuall
chaſtitie: all theſe oathes (wee ſaye) doe not binde a man, but are made
voyd and anihilated by the verie law it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="16">16 An oath that is raſhlie giuen, drawen by deceit, or
extorted by force or feare, bindeth the conſcience: if the matter be onelie
concerning ſome priuate dammage: it is the part of the Magiſtrate,
notwithſtanding, either to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie ſuch bands, according vnto equitie and
conueniency, or vtterly to diſſanull them.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Simplie to take an oath, is ſo farre from beeing
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Lorde (as the Anabaptiſts doe teach) that on the other
ſide, to vſe it holilie and lawfullie, is both neceſſarie and juſtlie
accompted a part of Gods woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Euerie needleſſe oath alſo, that is, ſuch as is
neither profitable nor neceſſarie, is forbidden in this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
            <p n="19">19 That an oath may be lawfull; there is required alſo,
that the verie forme of it be holy.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:1885:44"/>20 And ſeing that in an oth, God is
called, not ſimply a witnes, but as a witnes of the conſcience alſo, and
a reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of perjurie againſt the verie ſoule; it is a moſt great and
heinous ſinne, to ſweare by the thing that is created, much more, by
falſe Gods.</p>
            <p n="21">21 It is lawefull notwithſtanding, in the forme of an oath,
to make mention of Creatures; yet ſo, as in no wiſe, the religion of an
oath be referred vnto them. So MOSES and ESAY call Heauen and Earth to
witnes.</p>
            <p n="22">22 The penaltie is not without great cauſe, adjoyned vnto

            <head>PIRNCIPLES CONCERNING VOWES. XXXII.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>THE TREATISE OF VOWS IS TO BE AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto the diſcourſe
concerning an oath: we are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this place to intreat of them: and
firſt of all, to ſee what a vow is.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 A Vow is a promiſe of things lawfull, and poſsible, made
vnto God, with aduiſed deliberation, and to a godlie end; wherby a man
bindeth himſelfe to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſome thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For whereas euerie lawefull promiſe muſt proceede, not
onelie from the will, but alſo from the reaſon: it muſt needs be, that in
vowing, not onelie the bare motion of the mind is to be preſent, but euen a
ſure deliberation, wherto a purpoſe of binding a mans ſelf doth alſo
concur. Now this aſſurance doth not els-where depend then vpon a good
conſcience, grounded vppon Gods worde, by the <pb n="76" facs="tcp:1885:45"/> which,
nothing can be lightly or raſhly promiſed.</p>
            <p>The Ethnicks therefore in times paſt did, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts now a
daies doe, many waies offend in this point, who were, and are wont to make
vowes lightlie, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any word of God: ſo alſo did IEPHTE. IVD.
11.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But we are to take heede, that wee vowe nothing that is
vnlawfull; much more, that wee performe it not. For it is vnlawefull to
promiſe, or to offer any thing vnto God, that diſpleaſeth him: Next, wee
are to bee carefull, that our vowes be not of light, and jeſting matters:
third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they be not of thinges that are impoſsible for vs to
performe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The firſt ſort of theſe vowes, are ſuch, as wherby
men doe bind themſelues to commit ſome wickednes; of which ſort, was that
vowe, ACT. 23.12. And that of the mother of MICHA, IVDE. 17. The ſecond
ſort is of them, which, either doe take vpon them, or deny the doing of
ſomthing (that is indifferent in it owne nature) vppon this or that day. The
third is of them, who promiſe thoſe things that they are not able to
performe, as they doe, who vowe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Chaſtitie, which God vſeth not
to grant vnto all: but vnto ſome onely; and that often, but for a time.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Nowe, ſeeing GOD onelie is hee, vnto whome, wee owe our
ſelues, and all that wee haue; and that he is the onelye ſearcher of the
heart, and hath power to take puniſhment, of thoſe that breake their vowes;
wee juſtlie conclude, that our vows are to be made to him only. DEV. 23.21.
PSAL. 56.12.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts therfore do amiſſe, who vow at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
vnto Saints that are dead.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Som part of the ceremonial law conſiſted in vows,
whereby, men being mindfull of Gods blesſings, did offer giftes and
ſacrifices vnto him in token of thankeſgiuing: therefore they were
commaunded in the olde lawe, but the neceſsitie of vowing, togeather with
other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, were taken away at the comming of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7 For in the newe teſtament there is no commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
vowing mentioned, either in the Goſpell, or in <pb n="77" facs="tcp:1885:45"/> the
writings of the Apoſtles: ſeeing the whole dutie of a Chriſtian, is
contained vnder the rule of faith and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
            <p n="8">8 For the vow wherewith PAVLE bound himſelfe, was done vpon
conſideration of the time, and other circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the Apoſtle framing
himſelf vnto the Iewes, that hee might win them vnto Chriſt. Act. 21.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Yet vowes are nor altogether vnprofitable vnto
chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that by ſuch exerciſes they may conforme their wils vnto
well doing, &amp; reſtraine themſelues from euill: ſo that the cautions
aboue mentioned be obſerued: for nothing is to be vowed, which maketh not for
the ſetting forward of Gods glorie, &amp; the profit of our neighbour. And
after this ſort did IACOB, Gen. 28. and the Nazarites IVD. 6. make their
vowes.</p>
            <p n="10">10 And euen as an oath made raſhlie, and concerning
vnlawfull things, ought to bee anihilated: euen ſo a vowe that is either
vnlawfull or vnpoſsible, ought to bee juſtlie accounted of no force: And
therfore that common ſaying is not without good ground: In things that thou
haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie promiſed, breake thy promiſe: and this in like ſort,
In a godles vow change thy purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="11">11 For if in couenants that are betwene man and man thoſe
promiſes, doe onely binde vs wherewith the partie with whome we couenant,
will haue vs bound: it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd thing that we ſhould be compelled to
performe thoſe things which God requireth not, but refuſeth to be done.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts therefore are too obſtinat in the defence of their
Monaſticall life, abuſing thereunto manie places of the Scripture. Impure
alſo, and filthy is that PIGHIVS and CAMPEGIVS, who teach, that is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for him who hath vowed chaſtity, to haue a hundred Concubines one after
another, then to marry one lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wife; whereas the Apoſtle doth
perſwade them that haue not the gift of continency, that it is better to haue
a lawfull wife, then to burne.</p>
            <p>The thinges that are to bee vowed, are diuerſe: for the faithfull
in the olde time were wont to vow either men, 1. <pb n="78" facs="tcp:1885:46"/> SAM. 1.
or beaſts, LEVIT. 21. or thinges without life. 1. CHRON. 29.</p>

            <head>PRINCIPLES VPON THE FOVRTH COMMANDEMENT OF GODS LAVVE.
XXXIII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 EVen as in the reſt of the commandements of the firſt
Table, there is ſet downe in what points the lawfull worſhip of God doth
conſiſt: ſo in the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, wee are taught eſpeciallie
howe the faithfull ſhould exerciſe themſelues therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This commandement was not then firſt of all
eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, wheh the Lord deliuered the Law at Mount Sinay, but euen in
the verie creation of the worlde, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall of man. For
although man had neuer fallen, yet had he ſtood in neede of ſome order and
pollicie of the outward worſhip of God: the manner of which pollicye the Lord
him ſelf did then ſet down, thereby condemning wil-worſhip euen in the
integritie of man.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The fall of man comming vpon this, made the Lord in renuing
this commandement, which by little and little was decaied among men, to bring
other reaſons thereof, which were partlie altogether morall, and to continue
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the worlde, and partlie ceremoniall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie, ſeruing
onlie vnto the tutorſhip or Poedagogie of the Law, which PAVLE calleth the
rudiments of the world: And theſe reaſons were partlie ſet down by MOSES
in this commandement, and partlie in other places of the word.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Hence it commeth to paſſe, ſeeing in this precept is
contained not onlie the inward, but alſo the outward ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne obſeruation
of Gods worſhip, that the Prophets (by ſetting down a part for the whole)
do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the whole worſhip of God, vnder the obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</p>
            <p n="5">5 It is no maruell then, that this commandement though in
ſome things Ceremoniall, was yet by the Lorde <pb n="79" facs="tcp:1885:46"/> himſelf,
placed amongſt the nomber of theſe that are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and perpetuall:
becauſe at that time when this was firſt inſtituted, the inward
perpetuall worſhip of God, did altogether agree with the outward and
Ceremoniall.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The word SABBAOTH being deriued from SABBATH, which in the
hebrew ſignifieth, to reſt or to ceaſe, dooth note vnto vs, reſt and
ceaſing from our workes: and this name was at the firſt giuen vnto the
ſeauenth day, becauſe the Lord hauing finiſhed the work of the creation,
did reſt vpon this day, and it was afterward continued, becauſe the Lord
had forbidden his people to do any ſeruile work vpon the ſame.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now this commandement conſiſteth of foure mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: for
firſt of all is ſet downe the ſanctification of the Sabboth, which
reſpecteth GOD the authour thereof, who hath peculiarlie appointed vnto his
holy vſe, one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine day exempted from the order of the reſt. Secondlye,
the ſeuenth day from the beginning of the creation, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vnto this
Sabboth: Thridly, the Ceremoniall rite of this Sabboth is ſet down to be the
forbidding of euerie ſeruile worke: in the fourth place is laid before vs,
the ground of this ſanctification of the ſeauenth day.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The Ceremoniall things of this commandement, are the
appointing of the ſeauenth day, the rites of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ordained in the
Law to be done vpon this day: &amp; the reſting from all ſeruile works.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The morall thinges which are to bee continued vnto end of
the worlde, are the thinges which are ſhadowed out by thoſe ceremonies.
This ſeauenth day therfore, wherof there is neither euening nor morning
mentioned, did ſignifie that other euerlaſting Sabbaoth, to witt: the
perpetuall reſt of aeternall life, begunn heere; but to bee perfected in the
other worlde. Nowe the bodie of theſe legall rites and ceremonies, was
Chriſt. The reſt from all outward labour ſignified, that in the true
worſhip of God, we are required to aboliſh the ould man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to
ceaſe from all the workes that are meerelie ours, that is, from all kinde of
ſinne, to the ende that wee may <pb n="80" facs="tcp:1885:47"/> conſecrate both our
ſoules and our bodies; to knowe and to glorifie God.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Now whereas in other places, the reaſon why wee ſhould
ceaſe from bodilie labour is ſet downe to bee, the eaſe which both our
houſhold, and the beaſts we vſe in the neceſſarie affaires of this
life ſhould haue from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall toile, it commandeth mercie vnto vs,
which men are bound to ſhew in the moderate and ſparing vſe of the very
brute beaſtes.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Theſe Ceremoniall things therefore being fulfilled at
the comming of Chriſt, are juſtlie abrogated, but the things ſignified by
thoſe Ceremonies, are juſtlie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be done of vs.</p>
            <p n="12">12 We may therefore juſtlie affirme, that the Apoſtles by
the direction of the holie Ghoſte, in ſteade of that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day
obſerued vnder the Law, did appoint that day which was the firſt in the
creation of the former worlde: yet not therefore, becauſe it was the firſt
in that worke of the creation: but becauſe that Chriſt by his
reſurrection vpon that daye, did bring foorth that newe and aeternall light
of an other world: and therefore this day hath bene named the LORDS DAY, euen
ſince the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
            <p n="13">13 The obſeruation therefore of this Lords day, is not to
be accounted as an indifferent thing, but as an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall tradition to be
perpetually obſerued.</p>
            <p n="14">14 And that Chriſtians doe now ceaſe from their day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
labour vpon that day, it grew vnto vſe by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, by the
authoritie of Chriſtian Emperours: and yet is it not anie Iewiſh
obſeruation, ſeeing that neither euerye ſeruile worke is preciſelie
forbidden on that day, (wheras it is rather lawfull extraordinarilie at
ſometimes to recall againe the prohibition of thoſe workes that are
forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:) nor yet the ſaid reſt is nowe commanded vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
figuratiuelie, as it was in times paſt vnto the Iewes, but to the end that
laying all other cares aſide, we may ſo much the more freelie and
earneſtlie beſtowe our ſelues in the hearing and meditation of the
word.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:1885:47"/>15 And euen as the obſeruation of the
ſeauenth day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Iewes, was not ſo to be taken, as though God
had not bene to be worſhipped vpon the other ſix dayes: ſeeing that the
continuall ſacrifices was euery day offered both morning and euening: Euen
ſo in like ſort, the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Lords day, doth not forbid
ſermons or prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to be on other dayes: but rather commandeth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
peculiar &amp; a ſolemne profeſsion of the external wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God vpon
that day in the publik congregation. The Lord herein deling moſt mercifully
with vs, in that he gran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth vs ſix dayes, to beſtow our ſelues in a
holie ſort in our worldlie buſineſſe: and requireth no more to
himſelfe, but one of ſeauen. The reuollution of which ſeauen daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fetched from the creation of the worlde, doth mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the length of all ages
and times.</p>
            <p>The Iewes therefore are deceaued, and alſo thoſe, who together
with EBION, CERINTHVS and other ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious obſeruers of the Sabbaoth,
doe at this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that ſeauenth day to bee ſuperſtitiouſlie
obſerued amongſt Chriſtians: and ſo by laying a yoak vpon thoſe that
are deliuered by Chriſt, do go about to make chriſt vnprofitable vnto
vs.</p>
            <p n="16">16 And euen as alſo, beſides the obſeruation of the
Sabbaoth, which came about euerie ſeauenth day, there were other dayes
appointed vnder the Lawe, to celebrate ſome of the benefites of God,
whereunto it was lawfull to add ſome others, ſo it were to the ſame
purpoſe: and not to erect wil-worſhip, as were thoſe two daies named,
PV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIM, inſtituted vnder ESTHER, and alſo the feaſt of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of
the Temple: euen ſo alſo, there is nothing to the contrary, but that both
in particular churches, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo generallie in the whole church, ſome
ſuch daies may be ordained, according as the neceſsitie of occaſions, and
times do require.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Yet two things are heere neceſſarilie to bee taken
heed vnto: firſt, that thoſe daies bee verie fewe, leaſt that by ſuch
holie daies, an entrie bee opened to idlenes and riot, the which abuſes manie
of the auncient fathers doe <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1885:48"/> complaine to haue come to
paſſe in their time, at thoſe meetings which were celebrated at the
ſepulchres of the martyrs. The other, that no leauen of ſuperſtition,
much more of impiety, be intermingled with ſuch obſeruations: to be
ſhort, thoſe holie dayes (if need ſo require) muſt bee ſo
inſtituted, as all poſsible heed be taken, that no ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes do
creepe in: and eſpeciallie, that ſuch holie dayes be conſecrated vnto
none, ſaue vnto God.</p>
            <p>The Papiſtes therefore are to bee condemned, who fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſmal
beginning of that impiety, which firſt ſprang vp, from the reſort to the
graues of the Martyres, are growne to that paſſe, that they haue dedicated
vnto their Saincts, (as they call them) daies, Temples, and inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which
are joined, not onlie with vnſpeakeable riot, but euen with moſt open
ſuperſtition and horrible Idolatrie.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Seeing then the caſe thus ſtandeth, and that this
great wickedneſſe is ſo far growne, that it can not abide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie moderate
remedie: thoſe godly Magiſtrates and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, haue done religiouſlie
and wiſelie, who haue, either in part or whollie (as in ſome places)
abrogated the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of theſe dayes; yet is not the peculier
remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſome of the wonderfull acts of our Sauior Chriſt to be
therefore aboliſhed.</p>

XXXIIII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 HAuing alreadie expounded the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the firſt
Table, which do properlie and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarlie appertaine vnto the true and lawfull
worſhip of God: it is meete that wee lay open the commandements of the
ſecond, which do containe our dutie towardes our neighbor, &amp; firſt we
will deale with the firſt precept therof.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This commandement therefore may bee verie aptlie deuided
into two heads that is, into the commandement it ſelf, properly ſo called,
and the promiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:1885:48"/>3 In the commandement, are
diſtinguiſhed (by ſetting down one ſort for the whole) the diuers
degrees of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings appointed by God, to the behoofe of mans ſocietie:
namlie, to the end that euery man ſhould walke with great care in his owne
calling, neuer turning his eies from the bounds therof.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Therefore children (which is the firſt degree of mans
ſocietie) are commanded to honor their father &amp; mother, which thing
alſo nature it ſelf doth teach. By this name are comprehended both theſe
from whence we are come, and alſo thoſe that iſſue from vs, together
with our kinsfolke, both by father and by mother, our allies, and our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie

bound to performe anie obedience, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of their high place and
authoritie, as kings Magiſtrates, Lords, Maiſters: or by reaſon of their
age, as olde men, or thoſe vnto whom we are bound for ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, or by
any other knot of dutie.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The word (HONOR) containeth three things, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
obedience, and thankfulnes.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Reuerence is the acknowledgement &amp; regard, which is

in mind. So the ſonne is bound to honor &amp; reuerence both his parents, the
ſubject his gouernor, the yonger honor his elder in years, &amp; to be

            <p n="7">7 Obedience is the execution of the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the
ſuperiour, performed cheerfully and reddily by the inferiour, as far as lieth
in him: therefore ſonnes are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d willingly to ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto
their parents, and ſubjects vnto their gouernors: and to obey their
comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements with all their might.</p>
            <p>The Anabaptiſts then, do withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d both God &amp; nature, who
think, that there ought to be no vſe of magiſtrats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt chriſtians,
but that they are to be aboliſhed.</p>
            <p n="8">8 We are yet to take heed, that we yeeld not to our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
Magiſtrats, or yet to anie man, more than is meete: that is, that we haue
them not in Gods ſteed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:1885:49"/>And therefore they do greeuouſlie ſinne, who
hold, that whatſoeuer pleaſeth the Prince, ought to haue the force of a
law.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Thankfulnes doth then, manifeſt it ſelf, when as we do
freelie acknowledge, that we owe a dutie, vnto al thoſe of whome we haue
receaued anie benefite, and are readie to repay them againe, and that in fuller
meaſure if we bee able. Neither is it anie thing againſt this point, that
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe lay vp for their children, and not contrariwiſe: for it commeth
often to paſſe, that parentes doe ſtand in neede of the helpe and
ſupport of their children.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Euen as honor is to be yeelded vnto ſuperiours: ſo on
the other ſide, thoſe that are aboue others in degree, ar bound to performe
their duty towards their inferiours.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Parents therefore muſt take the care of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but ſo as they do not ſuffer them to haue too much of their owne will: that
is, that they doe not loue thoſe whome they haue begotten, either more, or
otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is meet. Of which ſort was the loue of ELIE towardes his
ſonnes, HOPHNIE and PHINEAS: whereas it is their dutie fatherlie to
chaſtiſe their offences.</p>
            <p n="12">12 It is the dutie alſo of Magiſtrats to regard the welth
of their ſubjects, to appoint, and by wiſe counſell to enact and ordaine
thoſe things, which belong to their quiet and peaceable eſtate in this
life. But as for thoſe things which appertaine vnto the ſaluation of our
ſoules, and doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the cauſes, preceptes, and meanes to obtaine the
ſame, it belongeth not vnto Magiſtrats to preſcribe them: but it is an
eſpeciall part of their dutie, both to ſee, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the authority
graunted vnto them, that the true worſhip of God bee lawfullie
eſtabliſhed according to his word, in the countries that are vnder their
gouernement: and alſo to defend the ſame being once eſtabliſhed,
againſt the violaters thereof, euen by puniſhing them with death, if the
caſe ſo require.</p>
            <p n="13">13 In this commandement alſo, the flockes are bound to obey
their Paſtors, and ouerſeers; and alſo cheerefullie to honour them, and
prouide for their maintenance: as <pb n="85" facs="tcp:1885:49"/> they on the other
ſide, are bound with great conſcience &amp; care to feede their flocks
committed vnto them.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Yet can neither the ſubjects with a good conſcience
obey their Magiſtrats, when they command them thinges that are manifeſtlie
impious and vnjuſt, nor the flockes yeelde obedience vnto their falſe
Paſtors, who goe aſtraie from the will of God.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Yet it is not lawfull for priuate men, to riſe or
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues violentlie againſt the Magiſtrates, that deale
tyranniouſlie with them: but it is their dutie, when anie ſuch thing
commeth to paſſe, either to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to praiers and pacience,
(which notwithſtanding muſte not carie vs away from that which God
requireth of vs,) or to flie vnto them vnto whome the Lawe hath giuen
authoritie to bridle and to reſtraine ſuch tyrants.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The particuler actions of ſome, which ſeemeth to giue
leaue to priuate men to take armour againſt a tyrant, are not raſhly to be
drawne into example.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Briefly we affirme, that within this commandement our
neighbour alſo is comprehended: that is, euerye man (our enemies and all)
vnto whome wee may doe good in the Lord: becauſe the lawes of nature it
ſelfe, do bind man vnto man.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Hitherto concerning the commandement. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
adjoined vnto the obſeruation therof, is anexed vnto it, firſt to the end
that men might bee more and more ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to yeeld the ſaid honour.
Secondly, that it ſhoulde be as it were, an earneſt-pennie of the diuine
couenaunt. Wherein alſo, mention is made of that land, which the Lorde had
appoynted, as it were, a pledge of his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt.</p>
            <p n="19">19 This promiſe belongeth vnto vs, not as far as wee
conſider the ſame, as it was ſometimes made vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the
Iewes, concerning that holie land: but in regard that whereſoeuer wee bee,
the earth is the Lords, and in what countrie ſoeuer we dwell, the ſame is
graunted vnto vs by the gift of God.</p>
            <p n="20">20 Now this promiſe is meruelouſlie agreeable vnto 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1885:50"/> the commandement it ſelfe, whereby the prolonging
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this life, is promiſed vnto him that honoureth thoſe, that
were the inſtruments of the life which he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p n="21">21 And euen as a long and a proſperous life is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
vnto obedient Sonnes; ſo on the other ſide, all diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, vnthankful,
and obſtinat Children, are aſſured of the puniſhment of infamie, joyned
with diuers and great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and torments.</p>
            <p n="22">22 Neither are we therfore to conclude, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
is vaine, becauſe neither thoſe are alwaies long liued, who performe this
dutie, neither yet al the breakers of this commaundement doe die in their
youth. For the Lorde doth ſo diſpoſe the blesſings of this life, as he
thinketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; and the ſooner hee calleth hence thoſe that are
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto their Parents, by ſo much the ſooner he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them:
now the long life of the rebellious, do ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the pacience of God, as
notwithſtanding, it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a curſe vnto them.</p>

            <p n="2">2 Directlie diuine, becauſe, that ſeeing God is the

againſt the Majeſtie of God, whoſoeuer doth erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate vnto him ſelfe

            <p n="3">

ſeemeth to bid battaile vnto all humanitie: whoſoeuer goeth about to
deſtroy the verie nature of man it ſelf, as far as in him lieth</p>
            <p n="4">4 Politicke, becauſe the other ſins of men againſt men,
do but annoy the ſocietie of man, whereas murther dooth vtterlie deſtroy
and abolliſh the ſame.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The ſlaughter of man onely is heere forbidden.</p>
            <p>The MANICHAES therefore doted, who thought that the vſe of thoſe
things ar here prohibited, which we can not enjoy, except their liues be taken
away from them.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Yet it is rightlie gathered, that all cruelty and
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadgenes in ſhedding the blood, euen of beaſts is here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
            <p n="7">7 He is not a manſlaier, vnto whome the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

            <p n="9">9 Magiſtrates are ſo bound to reuenge wilful murther, as
they neither can, nor ought to pardon their liues.</p>
            <p>The Anabaptiſts therefore are intolerable, who take away that
power from the Magiſtrate: and they are alſo greatlie to be reprehended,
who contrarie vnto al right and equitie, woulde perſwade men, that the

            <p n="10">10 The Magiſtrate is bound to defend his people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

            <p>It is then a moſt groſſe error, and moſt pernicious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p n="11">11 Seeing that the eſpeciall bande of publicke peace, 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1885:51"/> is the agreement in the true worſhip of God, the

that are manifeſtlie impious, againſt heretiks that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of their

Church.</p>
            <p n="12">12 This can bee no buckler to the vnjuſt perſecutions,
either of the Papiſtes or of anie other againſt the Church, which are
alwaies likelie moſt vnjuſt, both in reſpect of the matter it ſelf, and

            <p n="13">13 They are to be accounted wilfull murtherers, which haue

            <p n="14">14 Slaughter meerelie committed at vnawares: namelie, wherein

            <head>PRINCIPLES VPPON THE SEAVENTH COMMANDEMENT OF GODS LAVVE.
XXXVI.</head>
            <p n="1">1 SEeing wee haue dealt in the ſixt commandement, concerning
the preſeruation of mans life, which is the foundation of this commaundement,
and the reſt that followe: (for they who were not in this life, ſhould
neede neither marriage, nor riches, nor the eſtimation of their good name)
and that next vnto the care of our life, nothing is more to be regarded then
mariage; the commandement concerning the ſame, is juſtlie adjoyned next
vnto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The reaſon of this commandement, as of the former, is
three-fold, Diuine, Naturall, and Politicke or Ciuill.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Diuine, becauſe God, who himſelfe is holie, (and that
chaſtitie is part of holines) will haue vs therefore to liue chaſtly.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Natural, becauſe that ſeeing the conjunction of male and
Fe-male, is drawen from the very fountaine of nature: it behooueth the ſame
to bee pure, holye, and voyde of all vncleannes; and therefore, there was neuer
any nation, who at the leaſt, by the teſtimonie of their conſcience, haue
not condemned wandering and diſordered copulation of men and women, and
approoue marriage.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Politicke, becauſe it is behoofull for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welth,
that families ſhuld be diſtinguiſhed, &amp; that baſtards ſhould not
be taken in ſtead of true and natural Children, and Citizens: to be ſhort,
that peace and concord ſhould not be broken; all which would be diſordered,
if men were ſuffered to pollute themſelues in wandring and diſordered
conjunction.</p>
            <p n="6">6 In this commandement, by ſetting down the part for the
whole, is forbidden all copulation of men and women out of marriage, and alſo
al prouocation of luſt. Of vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full copulation, there are fiue ſorts;
Inceſt, Whordome, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, <pb n="90" facs="tcp:1885:52"/> adulterie, and
copulation againſt nature.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Inceſt is the conjunction of kinsfolkes or alies, which in
the degree and order of generation is forbidden both by the lawe of honeſty,
which is commonly called publick, and alſo by the lawe of God: Now with
theſe degrees can no mortal man diſpence. Deteſtable therefore is the
Pope, who claimeth vnto him ſelfe the power, to diſpence at his pleaſure
with theſe degrees. Neither doeth it anie waies make for him that in the
firſt ages, men maried their owne ſiſters, wherevnto they were enforced
by necesſitie, when as yet, mankinde was not multiplied, and ſeeing it was
the pleaſure of God, that from one male, &amp; one female, al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
ſhould be deriued, it was neceſſarilie vnderſtood that he did ordaine
the conjunction of Brethren and Siſters to be then lawful: But this ocaſion
ceaſing it is manifeſt, that he would not haue that cuſtome to be
accounted as a law.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Whoordome is the copulation of a man with a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, which
the law of God forbiddeth by the ſame reaſon, that it doth al other
conjunction out of mariage, for in all vnlawfull copulations, men ſinn
againſt their own bodies, and violate the temple of the holie Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Therfore of al other men they are moſt deteſtable, who think
that to avoid the greater danger, publicke ſtewes may bee allowed.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Fornication is committed, when an vnmaried man medleth with
a maide or a widowe out of marriage.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Adulterie is when as the bedde of marriage, (which ought
to be of one man, with one woman) is defiled either by the husband or by the
wife.</p>
            <p>Polygamie therfore, or the hauing of more wiues then on, although it
was a long time tollerated amongſt the auncient Fathers, yet was it neuer
lawefull, either by the teſtimonie of the conſcience, or in the preſence
of God: Neither did God ever allowe diuorcements, ſaue onelie in the caſe
of Adulterie.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Now if any man ſhall adjoyne force vnto any ſuch
vnlawefull copulation, there is no doubt but hee ſinneth more
grieuouſlie.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:1885:52"/>12 Conjunction againſt nature is, when
as either male with male, or female with female, doe in a brutiſh kinde of
furie, and ſuch as nature it ſelfe abhorreth, burne in luſt on towardes
an other: Or when as they pollute themſelues with beaſts, being a wickednes
moſt abhominable and not to be named.</p>
            <p n="13">13 This commandement doth belong vnto all, of what age,
ſexe or ſtate ſoever they be.</p>
            <p n="14">14 God who is the only ſearcher of the hart, and doth
abhorre all pollution in what parte ſoeuer of the ſoule or of the bodie it
doth appeare, forbiddeth vnto vs, in this commandement, not onelie theſe
outwarde ſinnes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the inwarde, and ſuch as are preparations vnto
luſt.</p>
            <p n="15">15 God therfore doth here eſpeciallie forbid the mind
within to burne with luſt, and even that in our eies, hands, or any other
behauior, &amp; jeſture of our body, there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that may ſauor of
wantonnes, and vnſhamefaſtnes: to be briefe, all filthy ſpeaking, and all
wanton writinges, and vndecent pictures are here forbidden by the Lord.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The Magiſtrate, ſeeing the breach of this
comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement doth moſt grieuouſlie anoy the ſocietie of man, is to
puniſh the offenders heerein, according vnto the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their faultes:
neither can it be juſtlie doubted, but that inceſt, adulterie, rauiſhing,
and copulation againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doe deſerue death, even by the law of
nations.</p>
            <p n="17">17 The Lord forbidding all vncleannes in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
doth on the contrary commaunde, that wee leade all the partes of our liues, in
Chaſtitie and ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
            <p n="18">18 And therefore they, who are not ſoe farre endued with
the guift of Chaſtitie, but that they burne, are bound to marie, and husbands
are to vſe the remedie of marriage in all moderation and honeſtie.</p>
            <p>The vowe of Chaſtitie therfore is to bee condemned, both as being
moſt vnagreeable vnto the lawe of God and nature, and alſo moſt
raſhlie, neither doth it binde the conſcience of any man.</p>

            <head>PRINCIPLES VPON THE EIGHT COMMANDEMENT OF GODS LAVVE.
XXXVII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 IN the two former commandements, care was had of the
preſeruation of mans ſocietie, as far as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed vnto the very
perſons themſelues: In this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, God requireth the maintenaunce of
their goods; thereby hauing regard, both vnto euery familie, and alſo, vnto
the common vtilitie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The reaſon of this precept, as alſo of the ſixt and
ſeuen is threefolde, diuine, naturall and polliticke.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Diuine, becauſe that wee muſt abſteine from theft,
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God doth forbid vs to ſteale, for he that is the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of
goods, is the diſpoſer and preſeruer of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Naturall, becauſe, as the Lawiers doe ſpeake; it is of
the lawe of nature, that ſome men doe poſſeſſe more, and ſome
leſſe, the which thing whoſoeuer doe confound, they violate the law of
nature.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Politicke, becauſe that vnleſſe, that theft were
forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, not onelie peace and quietnes among men, ſhould bee broken; but
alſo the whole ſocietie of men, ſhould bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p n="6">6 By theft, is comprehended in this commandement, by ſetting
downe the part for the whole, all kinde of injurie that is offered vnto the
goods of our neighbour, as the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king awaye of other mens goods, the vnjuſt
retaining of them, either by fraud, or by open violence.</p>
            <p>This commaundement then doth altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the confuſion
of goods, which certaine fantaſticall men, (and PLATO alſo in this point
not diuine) &amp; nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the Anabaptiſts of our time go about to
eſtabliſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="7">7 All goods are, either ſacred and diuine, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Sacriledge, is the ſtealth of thoſe goods, which 
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1885:53"/> are called Diuine: not becauſe God ſtandeth in neede
of them, but from the vſe and the ende to the which they are appointed:
namelie to the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Humain goods are either our own in proper, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon by
right of their vſe and poſſeſsion, or belonging vnto other men. Other
mens goods are in like ſort, as either publicke or priuate.</p>
            <p n="10">10 <hi>Peculatus</hi> or the robbing of the common
Treaſurie, is the ſtealing of the publick goods, when as a man doth take
vnto his own priuat vſe, the things that are the whole Common-wealths:
whereunto is annexed, the crime and accuſation of extortion or ill behauiour
in an office.</p>

XXXIX.</head>
            <p n="1">1 HAuing done with the ninth Commaundement, the tenth
remaineth to bee diſcuſſed, wherein the Lord ſetteth downe a lawe, not
onely for the outward act of the bodie, but euen for the inward thought of the
minde.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This commandement is ſet down in the laſt place,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <pb n="98" facs="tcp:1885:56"/> the beſt methode in teaching, is, to proceed
from the things that are known, vnto the things that are leſſe know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>en: Now
theſe thinges which doe conſiſt in a determined will, and afore appointed
deliberation or outward act, are better knowen then the inward thoughts, which
very few thinke to be ſinne, ſo they do not breake out into actions, and
none (as PAVL teſtifieth) can account them to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, except the
aſſent bee joyned vnto them, ſaue onelie thoſe who are inſtructed by
this commandement.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Nowe Concupiſcence in this place, is not onely, (as
commonlie they define it in the Scholes) a deſire of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant good, but
rather euery motion of the minde, euen the verie leaſt that is not agreeable
vnto the will of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The reaſon of this Commaundement is double, the former
whereof; is drawen from the nature of the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; who being a Spirite
moſt pure, hath ſet downe a lawe like vnto himſelfe, that is, a
ſpiritual, pearcing in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, vnto the moſt inward cloſet of
mans heart.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Vnto this reaſon, is annexed another; whereby a
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is ſet downe, betweene the lawes of God, and the conſtitutions
of other Law-giuers, howe wiſe ſoeuer they be.</p>
            <p n="6">6 For by the Politicke lawes of men, are condemned thoſe
things onelie, which are vnjuſtlie done or ſpoken, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the
Common-wealth, or againſt priuate men. Some Philoſophers indeed, reprehend
the verie euill affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as being of themſelues faultie: but yet onelie
ſo farr as, the will conſenteth vnto them.</p>
            <p n="7">7 But in this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement is conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, the very leaſt
thought that doth ſwarue from the will of God, (and doth not reſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble that
image, acording vnto which, the firſt man was created) although wee
aſſent not thereto; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the foundation of this Commaundement
pearceth deeplier then any laws of men, or any precepts of the
Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 They are therefore deceaued, who holde, that the
concupiſcence heere condemned, is onely an infirmitie, and not a
ſinne,</item>
               <item> 
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:1885:56"/>2 They erre much more greeuouſlie, who
doe not onely, not condemne this ſinne after Baptiſme; but alſo holde it
to be a kinde of matter left within vs, to kindle and ſtir vp vertue, by
oppoſing it ſelfe therevnto.</item>
               <item> 3 It is alſo manifeſt out of this Commaundement, that the
fulfilling of the Law, is altogeather imposſible, euen vnto the moſt holie
men; and it is apparant, that all men in themſelues are heere
condemned.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="8">8 Yet euery deſire and affection, are farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
condemned in this Commandement, for thoſe deſires to do good, which are
powred into the hearts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, are eſpeciallie commendable:
Neither are the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the naturall effectes, which God hath
engrauen in the nature of man, both for the deſire of thoſe things that are
agreeable vnto nature, &amp; alſo for the repelling of ſuch things as are

the Stoiacall immoouablenes of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as though God would haue men to
bee without naturall affections or ſenſeleſſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The rauing of franticke men, and the dreames of thoſe that
ſleepe, although they be teſtimonies of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature; yet are
they not properlie contained within this commandement.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Yet all vile and filthie dreames, and all other that
ſwarue from Gods lawe, are ſinfull in their manner, and ſtand in need of
the mercie of God; eſpeciallie, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the euill cogitations,
that wee haue had in the day time.</p>
            <p n="11">11 This Commaundement maketh not the Decalogue to haue any
Tautologie, or vaine repetition in it, neither is it any wiſe
ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p n="12">12 This Commaundement concerning concupiſcence, is one, and
not two.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts therefore are groſſe ſeducers, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who hauing blotted the ſecond commandement <pb n="100" facs="tcp:1885:57"/> out of the
firſt Table, and yet knowing that the number of the Commandements by the
authoritie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt bee ten, haue, to the end they might
craftily couer their deceit, rent this Commandement into two.</p>
            <p n="13">13 All wicked concupiſcence againſt the goods of our
neighbour, is heere forbidden; by ſetting downe a part for the whole, as it
is vſuall in the other Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="14">14 This lawe doth expreſlie make mencion of ſome of the
goods of our neighbour, as of his Houſe, his Wife, his Seruant, his Maid, his
Ox and his Aſſe: both that theſe few might be for an example of the
reſt, and alſo, becauſe that men doe for the moſt part more earneſtly
and commonlie couet theſe things.</p>
            <p n="15">15 That which is heere ſpoken vnto men [Thou ſhalt not
couet thy neighbours Wife,] is to bee vnderſtood, as ſpoken and commaunded
vnto women; namely, that they ſhould not couet the husband of another: for

            <p n="16">16 Out of the former things, the affirmatiue of this
Commaundement is eaſie to bee collected, which is; that whatſoeuer we
conceaue, meditate, or will, be joyned with the glorie of God, and the good of
our neighbor; the Lord herein commanding vs, that wee ſhould loue him with

            <p n="1">1 SEeing the wickednes of mans nature is ſuch, that not
onlie no man can performe the Law of God, but not ſo much as perfectlie
fulfil the leaſt part therof; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no man in this corrupt fleſh
can liue without ſinne; it will not bee amiſſe, now that wee haue done
with the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the lawe, to ſet downe the treatiſe concerning
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: <pb n="101" facs="tcp:1885:57"/> For euen as by the diligent reading ouer of
a thing, the faultes eſcaped in writing, are oft corrected; ſo the ſinnes
of our life are amended by repentance.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Repentance therefore, which the Hebrues call TSHV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH from
turning againe, and the Greekes <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
from the changing of the mind, may be thus aptlie defined.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Repentaunce is the true conuerſion of our life vnto God,
proceeding from the true and ſound feare of GOD, whereby, the ſinner
leauing the follie of ſinne, commeth home againe, &amp; changeth the former
purpoſe of his mind into a better.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Two things are diligentlie to be noted in this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the one (where we ſpeak of the conuerſion vnto God) that there is required
a renuing, not onely in our workes, but alſo in the very ſoule it ſelfe,
which then dooth caſt off the old man, when as, it bringeth forth the fruits
of works that are anſwerable vnto the renuing thereof.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the prepoſterous endeuours of hypocrites are to be
reprehended, who externallie make a ſhewe of outward repentaunce, when as in
the meane time, they neuer go about to vntie the bundles of iniquitie, which
they haue within them.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The other, in that wee teach, that it ought to ariſe from
the true feare of God: For the ſoule of a ſinner muſt be touched with the
ſenſe of Gods judgement, before ſuch time as it can be drawen to
repentance; For ſuch is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie of our fleſh, that vnleſſe it
be bruiſed with threats, as with a hammer, the ſlouthfullnes thereof will
neuer bee amended.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Now of Repentance there are two parts; Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
olde man, and the quickning of the Spirite.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Mortification of the olde man, is the abolliſhing of our
naturall corruption, which is doone by the Spirite of God, and is by little and
little, perfected by the ſame.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The quickning of the Spirite, or the gift of the newe man,
we define to be that power, which by little and litle, comming into the place
of the abolliſhing of our naturall corruption, (as the day ſucceedeth the
driuing away of the <pb n="102" facs="tcp:1885:58"/> darkenes) maketh that after we haue
knowen and allowed the will of God, wee beginne to do and to will, that which
is good.</p>
            <p>The Papiſticall diuiſion of Repentance, into contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
heart, confesſion of the mouth, and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the deed wee allow, if
it bee rightly expounded: but we refuſe the ſame, as altogeather falſe
and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in that ſenſe that they bring and vnderſtand it.</p>
            <p n="9">9 For they doe vnderſtand nothing els by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of
the heart, then that biting, wherehy, ſinne doth gnawe the conſcience,
either when it ſtandeth in the feare of the judgement, of GOD, or of mans,
that hangeth ouer it, or when it ſuffereth the puniſhment impoſed by
men.</p>
            <p n="10">10 But we call that a contrite heart, whereby the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is marueilouſlie greeued indeed, and that not with out the
biting of ſinne, but properlie by the inſpiration of the holie Ghoſt; not
ſo much for feare of puniſhment, as becauſe a man hath offended his GOD,
and by reaſon of the hatred of ſinne; the which heauines, the Apoſtle,
that he might diſtinguiſhe it from the other, which begetteth
deſperation, calleth ſorrowe or heauineſſe according vnto God.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Againe, moſt foule, and moſt contumelious againſt
the grace of God, is that other errour of theirs, whereby, they make that
biting of ſinne, which is altogeather dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, vnleſſe it be healed by
the grace of God, to bee a part of that puniſhment, which ſhould be paid as
a recompence for ſinne.</p>
            <p n="12">12 So alſo wee acknowledge, that the Scripture dooth make
mention of a double confesſion: The one, which is done either vnto God alone,
&amp; that either priuatly by one man, or publickly by the whole Church: or
that which is done vnto God and the Church, by thoſe who haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the
Church by ſome publicke ſcandall or offence: the other which is doone vnto
our neighbour, beeing hurt by ſome priuat injurie.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Now, this latter confesſion haue the Papiſts,
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <pb n="103" facs="tcp:1885:58"/> vnto the whole lawe of God, turned vnto an
auricular confesſion: ſetting downe a lawe, whereby with vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
tyranny they haue bounde miſerable conſciences to recken vppe their

ſacrificing Prieſt.</p>
            <p n="14">14 The puniſhments alſo called

               </gap> of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans being ordained
not for everie one, but for thoſe onely who ſinne with the publick offence
of the church, and who haue their cauſe made known before the Presbyterie,
not that anie ſatisfaction ſhoulde thereby be made vnto God, as though the
penaltie were ſatisfied, but to the end that the pride of the ſinner being
beaten downe, the Church might haue a ſure teſtimonie of his repentance
(thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments wee ſay) haue the ſaide Papiſts changed, with
manifeſt impietie into certaine formes of penalties, that partlie are full of
ſuperſtition, and partlie altogether blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous: which alſo they
teache to bee ſuch a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the penalty in the preſence of God,
as deſerueth remisſion of ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Vnto this moſt foule deluſion, they joyne an other
twofolde error, to wit, purgatorie, and indulgences wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indulgence was
nothing els at the firſt, but ſome miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſeueritie of the
Canons, whereby vpon good grounds, ſome fauour was ſhewed vnto thoſe that
had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, leaſt they ſhould haue bin ſwallowed vp with over much
heauines.</p>
            <p>Wee deteſt therefore that whole fable of purgatory, as being an
execrable impietie, and meere contrarie vnto our free reconciliation by
Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The lawe is properlie the object of repentance, as the
promiſes of the Goſpell are of fayth.</p>
            <p>Therfore to ſpeake properlie, Faith is the mother, and not a parte
of repentance.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Yet if by repentance wee will vnderſtand the whole
change of man vnto better, we acknowledge, that fayth is a principall parte
thereof, whereby a man is changed from beeing an vnbeleeuer, to be a
beleeuer.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Nowe we rightly gather by the former things, that 
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1885:59"/> repentance is a meere gift of God, and that it is
ridiculou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlie ſaid, to ariſe from our naturall free-will; ſeeing by
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are ſeruants vnto ſinne.</p>
            <p n="19">19 And ſeeing that the fleſh doth in ſome ſort
remaine in vs, two things doe followe thence; firſt, that continuall
Repentance is required of vs, as long as we are in this life: Secondly, that
Repentaunce is acceptable vnto God, not by any merrite thereof, but onelie by

            <head>PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE CONCEPTION OF IESVS CHRIST. XLI.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>SEING WE HAVE SVFFICIENTLY SPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the perſon and office of
Chriſt, and alſo of the Lawe, which bringeth vs vnto Chriſt: we thinke it
meet now, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to handle thoſe things, out of the Creed of the
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which Chriſt in the performance of his office hath done for vs,
beginning with his conception in the wombe of the Virgine.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 BY Conception wee vnderſtande, that which was made within
the Virgin; namely, that in deed, &amp; eſſentially ſhe ſhould beginne
to beare in her wombe, that Sonne of God which was true God and true man.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Neither was that man formed, any ſpace of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1885:59"/> the perſon of the word was vnited vnto him: but that
Man began to bee at the one and the verie ſame moment, that it was
perſonallie aſſumed by the aeternall word.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This humanity was, and ſhal continue for euer, a true and
a perfect humaine nature, in regard both of the bodie and ſoule, beeing then
made, when as it was conceaued in the wombe of the Virgine, and not before.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That aeternall perſon alſo of the word, or of the Sonn
of God, Coeſſentiall with the Father, is the true perſon of the Sonne of
God.</p>
            <p n="5">5 In this conception, which was a beginning in time of that
perſonall vniting; the one nature did not ſimplie aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the other,
but the perſon of the Sonne, tooke vppon him the nature of man in that one
particular man, and did preferre it vnto the dignitie of the perſon of the
Deitie: Wherein, notwithſtanding doe remaine, both the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp;
alſo their proprieties, wherby they are that which they are,
diſtinguiſhed without anie confuſion or ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Whereas DAMASCEN then, doth call the perſon of Chriſt
wholie conſidered, a compound perſon, becauſe hee is God and man, his
words are warily to be taken: For the partes concurring togeather, for the
making of ſome third thing, which of it ſelfe is not, (as the ſoule and
the body in the making of a man) doe of them ſelues exiſt before the third
thing made of them is exiſtent. But in the perſon of Chriſt, the Deitie
of the worde, doth not onely ſuſtaine the conſideration of the one
nature: but euen of the whole perſon, attributing this vnto that man, that
hee doth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the very Sonne of God, and is not man alone of him
ſelfe: For otherwiſe there ſhould be one perſon of the Son of God, and
another of the Sonne of man, neither wherof could of him ſelfe be the
Mediator.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The parts furthermore, that properlie make vpp the whole,
are compounded togeather: But the Deity can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no compoſition, ſeeing
it is moſt perfect; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this conception, it did preferre that
man vnto the dignitie of the diuine perſon: but ſo as nothing was added 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1885:60"/> thereby vnto the worde, but rather, that that man did
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this perſonall dignitie from the word, whereby, it is come to
paſſe, that (as wee haue ſaid) he is exalted aboue the Angels, the
natures yet remaining.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Therefore Chriſt was rightlie ſaid by the Fathers to be
greater then himſelfe, and leſſer then himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Nowe this aſſumed bodie, was made out of the
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of the Virgin Marie, according vnto the promiſes made by the
Prophets, in which reſpect, he the very ſame, who is the Sonne Coeternall
and Coeſſentiall with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is trulie the Sonne of ADAM, out of the
ſtocke of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BRAHAM and DAVID, Coeſſentiall alſo with his Mother.</p>
            <p n="10">10 This conception, the effect whereof, was the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
vnion of the word; and that man, could not posſiblie be wrought by the power
of any Creature.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Furthermore, Chriſt is ſaid in the beliefe, according
vnto the Scriptures, to bee conceaued of the holie Ghoſt, which is as the
Angell GABRIEL doth expound, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the moſt high, and the third
perſon in the Deitie.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Yet cannot Chriſt bee ſaid therefore, to be the Son of
the holy Ghoſt: for in this conception, the holy Ghoſt, doth not
ſuſtaine the conſideration of the Father, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of his owne
ſubſtance, but of a cauſe forming the fleſh out of a matter taken
els-where.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Yet is this Conception the worke of the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
but diſtinctlie conſidered; for the Father doth ſend his Son into this
fleſh, the Sonne is conceaued in this fleſh, the holy Ghoſt dooth forme
this fleſh out of the ſubſtance of the Virgin.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Although that that Virgine, bleſſed aboue all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
was yet the daughter of ADAM, and therfore infected of her ſelfe, with that
vniuerſall contagion of all mankind; whereof alſo vndoubtedly ſhe brought
forth ſome fruits: Yet notwithſtanding, the fleſh of Chriſt, was in no
wiſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with that contagion; but as the Angell witneſſed, he
remained from the very moment of his conception, a moſt pure
conſubſiſting habitation of the eternall Sonne.</p>
            <p n="15">15 For the holie Ghoſt, when hee tooke the ſubſtance 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1885:60"/> the Virgin, did altogeather cleanſe the ſaid
ſubſtance from all corruption, before ſuch time as hee turned the ſame
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſeed of mans fleſh.</p>
            <p n="16">16 In this moſt pure fleſh, was placed alſo a moſt
holie, and a moſt pure ſoule, that Chriſt alone ſhuld be that true
holie one of the Lord, making holie all his members for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; of whome, the
Leuiticall high Prieſt was onely a Type.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Wee condemne therefore the Samoſatenians, who will haue
Chriſt to be a bare man.</p>
            <p>The Arrians and Seruetians, who gaine-ſay his Coeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall

OF CHRIST. XLII.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>IN THE FORMER PRINCIPLES WE HAVE doone with the conception of
Chriſt: now wee are briefly to deale with his Natiuitie.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 EVen as theſe words of the Creed of the Apoſtles,
(conceiued by the holy Ghoſt,) do ſet forth the purifiyng of the ſeed of
the Virgin, to the end, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt might bee purely formed
thereof: So theſe wordes [Borne of the Virgin Marie] doe declare vnto vs, the
bringing forth of Chriſt into the world by the ſaid vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and ſo his
Natiuitie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Wee ſay that Chriſt was borne, (when as the vſuall
tearme of Child-bearing, common vnto all other men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fulfilled) the Virgin
brought forth Chriſt that word of the Father, and the Sonne of DAVID.</p>
            <p n="3">3 For hee which was conceiued, was alſo borne; The Virgin
Marie therefore is juſtly called the mother of God; though ſhe be not the
mother of the Deitie: And wee doe juſtlie condemne NESTORIVS, who made a
vaine diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the mother of Chriſt, and the mother of God; as
being things oppoſite the one to the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Of the ſure perſwaſion of this Natiuitie, wee reape a
double profit; the one, that hence we learne, that the word (yet without the
laying a ſide of his diuine nature, or anie conuerſion or mixture of the
ſame) hauing taken vppon him our fleſh, our ſoule and our minde, that in
all thinges, (ſinne excepted) he might be made like vnto his brethren; began
to be God and man.</p>
            <p>The Arrians therfore are to be condemned, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie our Sauiour
Chriſt to haue had an humaine ſoule; and the Appollinariſtes, who deny
him to haue had an humaine mind.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The other, that by this meanes wee might be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1885:61"/> that Chriſt according vnto the fleſh, is from thoſe
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of whome Mary came, that is from ADAM, ABRAHAM and DAVID, vnto whom
it was peculiarlie promiſed, that the Mesſias ſhould come of their
ſeed.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Hee was alſo borne (as it muſt needs bee) according vnto
the fore-telling of the Prophets, of a Virgine that was vnknown of man,
becauſe otherwiſe he could not be borne a pure man, and ſo he himſelfe
ſhould haue ſtood in need of a Mediator.</p>
            <p>The Iewes therefore are to be condemned, who holde againſt the
Chriſtians, that it was not needfull, that the Mesſias ſhould be borne of
a Virgine, but that he ſhould be the Son of ſome King or of ſome
Prophet.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The virginitie of Marie after her Child-bearing, to wit,
that as it is moſt certaine, that before her Childe-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſhe was
vnknowen of man; ſo alſo ſhe remained a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin after the ſame vnto her
dying day, is religiouſlie belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: yet there is nothing expreſlie found
concerning this point in the holie Scriptures, neither doth it belong
anie-wiſe vnto the myſterie of our ſaluation.</p>
            <p n="8">8 In this place, we do not onelie refuſe, but vtterlie
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, all filthie queſtions, and ſuch as are moſt vnagreeable vnto
ſo holy a birth.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Chriſt beeing an infant, and bound in his ſwaddling
bands after the maner of all other men that are borne, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ſwathes,
as alſo he did trulie ſucke milke: it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued alſo, that his bodie and
his humaine wiſdome (though it made greater growth in him then in other men)
and his experience did grow as he did increaſe in yeares; in ſo much as,
God would not haue the lawes of nature to bee broken in theſe things.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Chriſt therefore, at that time had a Childes bodie, and
afterward a mans, finite, and hauing the inſtrumentall parts thereof, and
therefore circumſcribed in a place, the which eſſentiall qualities of a
true bodie, hee neither did at any time, nor euer will caſt of.</p>
            <p>They err therfore, who teach, that the bodie of Chriſt can be
euerie where, and yet his humanitie remaine ſtill <pb n="110" facs="tcp:1885:62"/>
vnuiolated; neither doth it followe thence, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are
ſeparated.</p>
            <p n="11">11 That bodie euen vnto his death, was ſubject vnto humaine
infirmities, and ſo of it ſelfe ſubject vnto corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though it neuer
felt the corruption of the Graue: but after his reſurrection, he laid aſide
all thoſe infirmities that were brought vpon man for ſin, and euen the
naturall life it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Whence MANES is conuinced with MARCION, and thoſe whome they call
DOKITAE, who teach, that Chriſt in deede neuer did, or could ſuffer any
thing, and that he did onely beare men in hand that he ſuffered.</p>
            <p n="12">12 This Natiuitie was the beginning of the open hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
of Chriſt, whereby, he made himſelfe of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; namely, when taking

death and buriall was the laſt part of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Furthermore, in that he was circumciſed,

therfore, becauſe he in himſelfe nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be made cleane by them, as
though before he were poluted; but that we ſhould learne.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Firſt, that the whole force, both of the circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Fathers did, and of our Baptiſme dooth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vppon him, as beeing
hee, by whome the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are trulie made the ſigns of our reconciliation

both of the Fathers that were circumciſed, and alſo of vs that now are

meanes, he brought to paſſe that worke, which of all other the workes of
God, was the moſt holy and the moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; that is, the redemption of
his Elect: and as for the inſtruments, who ſinned not by compulſion, but
wilfullie, and againſt their owne conſcience, hee allotted them vnto moſt
juſt condemnation.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Thirdly, we conſider the effects of that ſacrifice;
name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the force of that moſt perfect obedience of his, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the
death of the Croſſe, whereby, we are clad with ſuch a righteouſnes, as
the law of God requireth; and alſo, the moſt ful ſatisfaction for all our
ſinnes, wrought by this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation once offered; whence doth follow
remisſion of ſins freelie, in reſpect of vs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Papiſts doe erre moſt foulie, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the
onely Pasſion of Chriſt, go about to place their own merites, and the
merites of Saints, as a needful ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie of the ſaide Pasſion, or as
though Chriſt was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore borne, that he might powre into vs the force to
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite aeternall life of our ſelues.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Nowe, ſeeing Chriſt was true man, that is,
conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a true ſoule, and of a true bodie of a man; he had a body
ſubject vnto outward pasſions, and therfore, he bare moſt greeuous
ſufferinges in his bodie, to the end, that hee might trulie deliuer vs, euen
in reſpect of our bodies.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Now, in reſpect of the ſoule, he was ſtrucken thorow
with moſt vnſpeakable anguiſhes and torments: yea, hee ſuffered in his
ſoule, the moſt horrible and fearefull bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of Gods wrath, that he
might deliuer our ſoules from <pb n="113" facs="tcp:1885:63"/> the euerlaſting
torments of Hell.</p>
            <p>They therefore are to be condemned, who haue affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that
Chriſt, either did not ſuffer, as the Simonians or that hee did not trulie,
but ſuppoſedly ſuffer, as the Marcionites and the Manichaees did.</p>
            <p n="12">12 The Diuinitie notwithſtanding, which was perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
vnited vnto the humanitie that was aſſumed, did not depart therefrom in the
time of the pasſion; but it ſo farre with helde it ſelfe in not ſhewing
the force thereof, vntill that his ſoule did vnſpeakablie apprehende and
feele the wrath of God, then the which nothing can bee imagined more horrible;
the burthen whereof, he had neuer bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuſtaine, vnleſſe at
the laſt, he had bene ſtrengthened to gaine the victorie by the ſame
Deitie of the word.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Ieſus Chriſt then, to ſpeake properly, ſuffered in
his bodie and in his ſoule; yet notwithſtanding, we may trulie and
Chriſtianlie ſay, that the Lorde of glory was crucified, dead, &amp;c. not
that the Deitie did ſuffer, (for the Diuinitie is imparible) but that this
bodie and this ſoule, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per body and the proper ſoule of the
WORD.</p>
            <p>We doe deteſt therefore, both the open Eutychians, who as they
confound the proprieties and the natures: ſo they hould, that the Deity did
ſuffer; &amp; alſo the cloſe and ſecret Eutychians, who are compelled
in deede to confeſſe, that the Deitie did not ſuffer, but yet do hould,
that the communicating of the proprieties of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and the Manhood, are
reall; euen in reſpect of the natures them ſelues, and therefore, that the
WORDE in reſpect of it ſelfe, did ſuffer ſome thing.</p>
            <p n="14">14 That baſe eſtate of the WORD, whereby he made
himſelfe of no reputation, not in himſelfe, but in the fleſhe which was
aſſumed, was eſpeciallie ſeene, as it were with the eies in his
Pasſion, wherein the aeternall Sonne of God as wee may ſay, forgetting
himſelfe, if I may ſo ſpeake, did haſten of his owne accord vnto ſuch
a puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="15">15 The condemnation of Chriſt vnder CAIPHAS and PONTIVS
PILAT, which is a matter of no ſmall moment &amp; conſideration, went
before the puniſhment which he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: <pb n="114" facs="tcp:1885:64"/> For when as
we could not ſtand before the Tribunall ſeat of God, Chriſt appeared
before the ſeat of the high Prieſt PONTIVS PILATE; yet was he by and by
condemned to be hanged vpon the Croſſe; the juſt for the vnjuſt, that
he might ſet vs free from the judgement of GOD the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The kind of puniſhment wherevnto he was judged, was the
Croſſe; then the which, there was nothing more ignominious, euen by the law
of God, to the end we might know, that hee was not onely dead, but alſo made
a curſſe for vs.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Chriſt therfore, being the true and the onely Prieſt,
performing the worke of the Mediatour-ſhippe, as all the ſhadowes of the
lawe did prefigure him, carrying about with him that Tabernacle of his bodie,
entred once into the holie place, where vppon the Altar of the Croſſe, hee
once offered himſelfe a Sacrifice and a brunt offering vnto his Father, by
ſheadding his moſt precious bloode; hee I ſay, beeing the Prieſt, the
Sacrifice, the verye redemption, ranſome, and propitiation, and euen all
theſe thinges for euer.</p>
            <p>Wee deteſt therefore with all our hearts that blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
whereby the Papiſts are not affraid to affirme, that Chriſt is as yet daily
offered vnto his Father, reallie and in deed for the quick and dead, by the
ſacrificing Prieſt: then the which blaſphemie, nothing can bee more
exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Nowe Chriſt by his death, hath abolliſhed both the
firſt and the ſecond death vnto his Elect. The firſt death, not that he
hath fully deſtroyed the ſame, but that he hath chaunged it in ſuch
ſort, as it is no longer a puniſhment of ſinne, or an entry vnto the
other death, but a paſſage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to aeternall life.</p>
            <p n="19">19 The latter indeede, in reſpect that hee beeing dead, did
altogeather put it vnder his feet, and openly triumph ouer the ſame:
wherefore alſo wee are no longer to feare it.</p>
            <p n="20">20 By the death of Chriſt, wee vnderſtand the true
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration <pb n="115" facs="tcp:1885:64"/> of his ſoule from his bodie: the which
ſoule (as hauing it in his owne hands) when he had fulfilled al theſe
things which were foreſpoken of the Prophets, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſatisfaction
for vs, and hauing performed all the ſolemnities of the true expiatorie
ſacrifice; hee willinglie calling againe and againe with a great crie on his
Father, gaue vp.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Yet was not the Diuinitie of Chriſt therefore
ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in his death, either from his bodie or from his ſoule; but it
was alwaies perſonallie vnited vnto both, in ſuch ſort, as that band of
the perſonall vnion was neuer bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſome haue not taught aright, in giuing out that Chriſt
by his death, ceaſed to be man.</p>
            <p n="22">22 Laſtlie, beſides all the fruites which wee drawe (as
hath beene ſhewed) from the paſsion, croſſe and death of Chriſt, this

INTO HELL. XLIIII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 ALL theſe things that Chriſt ſuffered or did for our
cauſe, are in the ſecond part of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Creed, comprehended in
the actions of his humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or exaltation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The actions of his humiliation, are either of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
or of his open humiliation: of his ſecret is his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all the reſt
euen vnto his Reſurrection are of his open humiliation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Wee haue hitherto dealt, concerning the act of his ſecret
humiliation, and alſo, concerning the foure firſt heades of his open
humbling, his Natiuitie, Pasſion, <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1885:65"/> crucifying, and
death; the two latter aboue named do yet remaine; viz. his Buriall and his
Deſcenſion into Hell, the former whereof, belongeth vnto his body, the
latter vnto his ſoule, as afterward we will ſpeake.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The Buriall of Chriſt is to be expounded, euen as the
wordes themſelues doe ſound, wherein are to bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Firſt, the
perſons who buried Chriſt: Secondly, the forme and manner of his burial:
Thirdly, the end: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the effects: Fiftly, the place: Sixtly, the time
he remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the graue.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The perſons who buried him, were IOSEPH of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea, and
NICODEMVS, who hauing obtained the bodie of Chriſt of PILATE, did anoint the
ſame with Balme, and wrapped it in fine linnen, and afterwards buried it: In
all which points, we haue a ſinguler example of faith, and alſo of Gods
prouidence, hereby making a way to the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The forme of his buriall, conſiſteth in his anointing,
(the which in reſpect of God, was a type of that liuely ſmel flowing from
the death of Chriſt) his winding &amp; laying in the graue, which were
aſſured teſtimonies of his death.</p>
            <p>And here wee are not to conceale their notable deluſion, who not
onely ſuperſtitiouſlie, but alſo ignorantlie and fooliſhlie, doe in
<hi>Sauoy</hi> offer a certaine Linen to bee worſhipped, wherein Chriſt
ſhoulde bee wrapped in the graue, the which they alſo fooliſhly call a
handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherffe or napkin, wherein the whole bodie of Chriſt is painted:
wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Iewes according to their cuſtome, doe onelie binde the head in a
Napkin.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The endes of this buriall are manifolde: For firſt of al
Chriſt would therefore be buried, that he might be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be truly
dead. 2. That he might perſue death, fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were, vnto her innermoſt
denne. 3. That hee might make our buriall ſmell of the liuelie ſauour of
his death, and ſo driue away from vs the horror of the graue. 4 That by this
meanes, hee might leaue a ſure teſtimonie of the reſurection.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The effect of the Burial of Chriſt, is firſt of all
this; that as dying, he ouercame death, and perſued this victorie of 
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1885:65"/> his, that he might deliuer his bodie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the effect of
death, that is, from being turned vnto duſt: euen ſo, by the ſame power
of his, hee might bring the bodies of his members, vnto aeternall incorruption.
The other is, that euen as the burial of that bodie, which was aſſumed into
for vs, a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual &amp; an aeternall life, was a certaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of
death, ſo is it vnto vs a pledge of the ſpirituall death of the olde man,
dying in vs by litle and little: in which reſpect we are ſaid in Baptiſme
to be buried with him into his death.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Neither is the bodie of ſinn weakned in vs at a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but by continuall progreſſe dooth dailie more and more languiſhe, vntill
it bee made altogeather without ſtrength, which ſhall then be, when wee
ſhall perfectlie riſe againe.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Hee is ſaid to bee buried in a Fielde, neere vnto the
place where he was crucified, and that in a newe graue cut out of a rocke, that
it might bee clearlie manifeſt, that hee was trulie buried; and therefore,
alſo that hee roſe againe, and not ſome other in his ſtead.</p>
            <p n="11">11 As concerning the ſealing &amp; watching of the graue,
both came to paſſe by the gret prouidence of God; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that the moſt
extreame enemies of Chriſt, by whoſe ſeal and guard, the Sepulchers was
made ſafe, might bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled againſt their wils, to confirme the
Reſurrection of Chriſt, that by and by followed.</p>
            <p n="12">12 It was not neceſſary, that the time wherein hee lay in
the graue, ſhould in euery point bee anſwearable to the Type of IONAS; but
we are to know, that (Chriſt haſting as it were vnto the victorie) the
Scripture is wont, by ſetting down a part for the whole, to giue the name of
ſome whole thing to the beginning and end thereof. So Chriſt beeing put in
the graue, at the latter end of that day, which went before the Sabaoth, lay in
the graue the whole Sabboth, according to the cuſtome of the Iewes, which
account a naturall day, from Euening to Euening, and roſe againe the
beginning of the next, which was the firſt daye of the weeke.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Concerning this Article of the deſcenſion of Chriſt 
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1885:66"/> into Hell, it is manifeſt, that there is no mention
made of either, in the Nicene or in any other of the ancient creeds, and
RVFFINVS witneſſeth, that it was not read in the Church of Rome.</p>
            <p n="14">14 No man therefore ought to wonder, if ſome queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be
made of the meaning thereof.</p>
            <p n="15">15 That the Creede, which is called the Apoſtles, was
written by the Apoſtles themſelues, before they departed from Ieruſalem,
euerie one of them bringing in his ſeueral Article, it is a meere fabulous
tale, as the very number of theſe Articles do ſhew.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Yet it is cleare, that they were faithfullie and truely
gathered out of the preaching of the Apoſtles, &amp; acounted euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
moſt ancient time, as a ſquare &amp; a rule of faith</p>
            <p n="17">17 Now their opinion is verie probable, who doe take theſe
words, [he deſcended into Hel] (if this Article was at the firſt in the
common creed, expreſſed in ſo many words) not for any diſtinct Article,
but for a ſummary comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the laſt and loweſt degree of
Chriſtes humiliation, which ſhould bee pointed out by the wordes of
ſuffering, crucifiyng, death, and burial; as this kind of ſpeach is
ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Scriptures Metaphorically vſed, for the loweſt eſtate
of anguiſh and dejection: So that, [He ſuffered, was dead, buried, and
deſcended into Hell,] ſhould be but one Article of faith.</p>
            <p n="18">18 But who can beleeue, that the Fathers of Nicene, and ſo
many Synods that afterward followed, and the very Church of Rome it ſelf
would haue raſhly blotted out this Article, if it had bin written in ſo
many words in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Creed.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Either of the two therefore muſt needs bee
neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; namelie, that either this kinde of ſpeach, in that ſenſe
that wee haue ſpoken, though familiar vnto the Hebrues, was not yet receiued
in all Churches, as being ambiguous and not neceſſary; ſeeing it was
ſufficiently vnderſtood by the former, and ſo by a little and a little,
grewe out of vſe: or that this Article alſo, was then inſerted into the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Creed, when as their opinion, which hath bene of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient 
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1885:66"/> time, had by degrees taken place, who thought that the
ſoule of our Sauiour Chriſt, beeing ſeparated from his bodie, went into I
know not what place, where the Spirits of the beleeuing Fathers ſhould haue
their aboad.</p>
            <p n="20">20 But this opinion, though it hath bin of a long time
receaued, by a common and an olde growen error, cannot bee confirmed any wiſe
by any teſtimonie of the Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Hiſtorie, but is manifeſtlie
ouerthrown thereby, ſeeing it is very apparant by the woordes of the
Euangeliſts, that the Spirite of Chriſt, being departed out of his bodie,
was there receaued, into whoſe hands hee committed it when hee gaue vppe the
Ghoſt, that is, into the place of aeternall bleſſednes, whereof
ſpeaking vnto the Theefe, he ſaid; [this day ſhalt thou be with me in
Paradiſe.]</p>
            <p n="21">21 Nowe, that there was any place allotted vnto the Spirits
of the Fathers, that departed before the incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, whence
afterward, the Spirite of Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither indeed, ſhuld bring them
with him into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; it can in no wiſe bee confirmed by any colourable
te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the Scriptures: Neither would the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts haue omitted
any ſuch thing in the ſtorie of the pasſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt: But this
opinion ſeemeth to ariſe, partlie, in that manye are written to haue
riſen, either by Chriſt, or with Chriſt: partly, out of the PSALME 16.8.
which PETER citeth Act. 2.25. and out of two other places alſo of 1. PET. 3.
wrongfullie interpreted.</p>
            <p n="22">22 Out of this error, ariſe two other that are more
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, the one of thoſe, who beeing ledde by the miſvnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of
the words of PETER, thought that the ſoule of Chriſt went indeed into Hell;
to the ende, that as in bodie hee had preached the Goſpell vpon earth, vnto
thoſe that were liuing: ſo alſo he ſhould preach the ſaid Goſpel in
his Spirit, vnto the Spirites of thoſe that were dead, as though that after
death, there were any place left for preaching &amp; repentance.</p>
            <p n="23">23 The other errour is of thoſe, who dreamed that the
Spirite of Chriſt ſhould goe vnto the ſoules of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that hee
might there alſo ſuffer in his ſoule, the paines <pb n="120" facs="tcp:1885:67"/>
ordained in hell for the damned: as though that the ſoule of Chriſt,
whileſt it was in his bodie, did not beare thoſe puniſhmentes for our
ſake; as both that horrible agonie, which hee ſuſtained in the Garden,
and alſo, that fearefull crie, [My God, my God, &amp;c.] which vpon the
Croſſe made Heauen and earth to tremble, doe beare witneſſe: or as
though, that ſpeache, [It is finiſhed,] wherein our whole hope
conſiſteth were vntrue.</p>
            <p n="24">24 But wee (omitting the whole controuerſie, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the putting in, or the blotting out of this Article) do ſimplie vnderſtand,
by the Deſcenſion of Chriſt into hell, thoſe things, which Chriſt
being made a curſe for vs, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his ſoule for our ſake, in
thoſe torments eſpeciallie, which were ſo greeuous, as nothing could be,
no not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined more horrible.</p>
            <p n="25">25 By the word DESCENSION therefore, is not ment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
remoouing from a higher place to a lower, becauſe that can properlie agree
neither vnto the Deitie, which is euery where, nor vnto the bodie, which of it
ſelfe lay dead in the Graue, neither vnto the ſoule, which beeing commended
vnto the Father, was ſtraight way in Paradiſe, after it was ſeparated
from the body.</p>
            <p n="26">26 Now the word HELL, which in the Scripture is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly
taken, ſignifieth neither the Graue, becauſe that explanation ſhould bee
ſuperfluous and obſcure; neither yet the place of the damned, as it is
cleare out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Principles.</p>
            <p n="27">27 Therefore this Deſcenſion of Chriſt into Hel, which
had an ende at his death, went before the Article of his buriall: but yet it is
placed after the ſame in the order of ſpeach, euen becauſe it was thought
meet, to ſet downe in one tenor of ſpeach, whatſoeuer did belong to the
humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of his body.</p>

XLV.</head>
            <p n="1">1 HItherto wee haue heard Chriſtes combate with death;
wherein he might ſeeme to be ouercome by death, becauſe it ſo far
preuailed againſt him, as it threw his dead bodie into the graue.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Now we are to ſpeake of Chriſts victorie ouer death: the
beginning whereof, was the preſeruation of his dead bodie in the graue,
vncorrupted: and that without the help of anie art of the Apothicarie.</p>
            <p n="3">3 His full victorie manifeſted it ſelfe in the
reſurrection of his bodie: ſeeing that life is directlye oppoſite vnto
death.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Now, that onlie is ſaid to riſe again, which lay down,
and therefore, neither the Deitie nor the ſoule of Chriſt roſe againe.
Yet notwithſtanding, the reſurrection after a ſort doth appertain vnto
the ſoule: namelie, in that reſpect that by the reſurrection it was
reſtored againe vnto the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that is, vnto his proper inſtrument.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Heere it is alſo gathered, that the ſame verie bodie
which was laid in the graue, roſe againe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The Reſurrection did aboliſh none of the eſſentiall
qualities of the bodie: of which ſort are, to haue a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to bee
finite: whence followeth, that it is alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed within the compaſſe
of the members thereof; and is contained in a place.</p>
            <p>We do condemne therfore the Eutychians, who held that he had a
bodie, that was not bodilie: and the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians, who ſaid that it was an
aierie bodie: and the Marcionites, who turned his true bodie vnto a ſhadow,
both before and after the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p n="7">7 By the ſame reaſon alſo doth fall to the ground that
inuented forgerie, both of Tranſubſtantiation, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
as beeing altogether repugnant vnto the truth of the bodie of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:1885:68"/>8 Chriſt was the firſt that roſe
hauing ſwallowed vp mortalitie, and remooued at once all the infirmities of
the naturall life from him ſelfe: although that after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he
did trulie eat and drinke, that he might make vs fullie aſſured, that he
tooke vpon him again a true bodie.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Chriſt (which is proper to him alone) roſe againe by the
power of his owne Deitie, and not by any borrowed ſtrength, or by the force
of anie creature.</p>
            <p>Therefore his Reſurrection is a moſt true demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that
he was trulie God.</p>
            <p n="10">10 There was great cauſe why Chriſt ſhoulde ryſe the
third day, and not before; leaſt that if he had riſen ſooner, his death
ſhould haue ſeemed to be but fained, or if he had ſtaied longer in the
graue, the faith of the elect might haue beene hazarded.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The Reſurrection of Chriſt was neceſſarie to the
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of our ſaluation, becauſe that as it behooued him to
ſuffer the death due vnto our ſinnes; ſo alſo it was needfull that
death ſhould bee ouercome by him, that hee might bring vs vnto aeternall
life, beeing deliuered from mortalitie.</p>
            <p n="12">12 It was agreable alſo vnto the juſtice of God, that
Chriſt ſhould enioy aeternall glorie, euen by the condition of the legall
couenant, which is, do this, and liue.</p>
            <p n="13">13 The Reſurrection of Chriſt is a ſure pillar of our
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, becauſe the church is as it were, the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or filling
vp of Chriſt: and therefore taking away that head of Chriſtian religion,
vaine were the preaching of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Therefore we deteſt from our harts the Saducees and all
Philoſophers, that haue denied the reſurrection of the fleſh.</p>
            <p n="14">14 The doctrine of the Reſurrection hath beene
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie held in the church of God: the which alſo though it do depend
vpon the omnipotencie of God onelie, may yet in ſome ſort, by laying downe
ſome ſure grounds and principles, bee probablie gathered by humaine
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1885:68"/>15 Our bodies ſhall not be two in
nomber after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, but the verie ſame bodie that lay downe in
the graue ſhall riſe againe.</p>
            <p>The opinion therefore which IOHN the Biſhop of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem held
concerning the taking vp of an other body is worthelie condemned.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The Reſurrection of Chriſt doth properlie belong vnto
the elect: ſeeing the wicked are to ryſe againe not by the vertue of his
reſurrection, but by the juſt judgement of GOD vnto aeternall damnation,
euen by the force of that penaltie, which GOD added vnto the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hee
gaue to ADAM: The day that thou ſhalt eate, thou ſhalt die the death, euen
the firſt and the ſecond death.</p>
            <p n="17">17 It is no wonderfull caſe, that Chriſt after his
Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection did not openlie manifeſt himſelf vnto all men: for as there
is a time of mercie, ſo is there a time of judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with God.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Chriſt proued his Reſurrection vnto his diſciples,
by all kinde of arguments: as, by the teſtimonies both of Angels, of weomen,
and of men vnto whome he preſented himſelfe aliue, euen in the ſame bodie
that was marked with the ſcarres of the wounds: adding thereunto alſo the
teſtimonies of the Prophets.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Vnto all theſe things he adjoined his conuerſation
which he had with them for the ſpace of fourtie daies, leaſt either a
ſhorter time ſhould not ſuffice, or if he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued longer, he might
ſeeme to haue riſen to ſuch a life, as he lead heere at the firſt.</p>
            <p n="20">20 Hetherto alſo belongeth the manner of his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
which was in ſome reſpect naturall: that it might be manifeſt, that
neither his reſurrection nor his glorie did take from him his true humanitie,
whereby he is and ſhall be our brother for euer: and yet notwithſtanding
ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall that all might knowe him, hauing laide downe this naturall
life to be vnto vs, the firſt fruits of a ſpirituall and an aeternall.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Now, ſeeing both this hyſtorie of the Reſurrection, 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1885:69"/> and alſo teſtimonies of the Prophets which fore-tolde
the ſame, were publiſhed openlie and in the audience of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as would
heare, not onelie of the Iewes, but of al other people, and was alſo
confirmed by all kinde of miracles: it muſt needs be, that neither the Iewes,
nor anie other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can complaine, that Chriſt after hee had riſen
againe, did not offer himſelf to be ſeene of them.</p>
            <p n="22">22 And ſeing that Chriſt came to ſaue his elect wholly,
both ſoule and bodie: and that his reſurrection is his true and full
victorie: it followeth, that that ſpirituall reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (whereby it
commeth to paſſe that our ſoules beeing ſpiritually vnited vnto
Chriſt, the old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beginneth to die in vs, &amp; being by little and little
to be worne away, is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and the new man riſeth again) doth depend vpon
the reſurrection of Chriſt; that euen as Chriſt after his
reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; not before (as far as he is our head) began to liue that
aeternall life, after he had ouercome all the infirmities of this naturall
life, which (ſinne excepted) he had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone for our ſakes: ſo that
qualitie of an vncorrupted life being begun in our ſoules while we liue
heere, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding farther, after the diſſolation of this bodie, is at
the length to bee fullie perfected, when the reſtitution of our bodies
ſhall be accompliſhed: and ſo the elect ſhall liue that aeternall life
with Chriſt, the type of which benefite is the Sacrament of Baptiſme vnto
vs.</p>
            <p n="23">23 Nowe, euen as the Spirit of Chriſt paſſed from the
Croſſe into Paradiſe, at the verie ſame moment that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of
the bodie, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce returned into the bodie, that whole Chriſt in
reſpect that he was man, might be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards glorified: ſo we do beleeue
that their ſpirits who die in the Lord, do ſtraight way depart vnto God,
there to enjoy that meaſure of glory that is appointed for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that
they beeing adjoined againe vnto the ſame bodies (which will be the verie
ſame in ſubſtance trulie corporal, though in a far more excellent
eſtate) ſhal liue vnder Chriſt their head for euermore.</p>
            <p>We do condemne therfore, both that fable of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fire, and
alſo their doctrine, who dreame that the <pb n="125" facs="tcp:1885:69"/> ſoules of
the departed, are a ſleepe vntill the laſt day of judgement.</p>

            <head>PRINCIPLES CONCERNING CHRIST HIS ASCENSION INTO HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEN.
XLVI.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>SEING THE ARTICLE OF CRISTS RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection hath bene alreadie
opened: it now followeth, that we deale with his aſcenſion into heauen.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 AS the Scripture dooth teach, that the death,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and buriall of Chriſt were true, and not fained; ſo, the
ſame doth teſtifie, that his Aſcenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, was not onely
viſible, but alſo locall.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For although, the word ASCENDING, is ſometimes
Figuratiuely ſpoken concerning God; yet in this Article of the Faith, it is
taken in his proper and naturall ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſuch ſort, that by it
is expreſſed a paſſage, from a low<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er place vnto a higher, which is
pointed out by the name of Heauen.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Whereas in the Scripture, there is mention made of a
three-folde Heauen; wee affirme, that the higheſt of all, is heere to bee
vnderſtood: wherein, is the ſeat and aeternall habitation of the ſoules
of the faithfull, and where alſo, Chriſt is exalted aboue all
Creatures.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And although, he be trulie aſcended into Heauen; yet doth
it not follow thence, that he is no more preſent here with his Church for the
gouernment thereof: ſeeing that the ſaid Aſcention, dooth onely
appertaine vnto that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is finite, and contained in a place; that
is, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his humanitie, and not to his Diuinitie, which is euery where alwais
preſent, and can be contained in no certaine place, ſeeing it containeth
all things: For as AVGVSTINE hath ſpoken very notablie, the body wherein
Chriſt roſe, <pb n="126" facs="tcp:1885:70"/> muſt bee in one place, where as his
trueth is euery where ſpread abroad.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Hence we gather, that hee is not now vpon earth, in
reſpect of his Manhood; ſeeing he hath once aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that place,
whence the Scripture dooth teſtifie that hee will not depart, vntill the
reſtitution of all thinges, and in no other manner neither, then he did
aſcend.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Yet wee ſay, that God and man did aſcend, becauſe that
his humaine bodie was taken vp by the power of the Deity, which was
vnſeparably joyned with the humain na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and nowe remaineth there after a
manner vnknowen vnto vs.</p>
            <p>They are deceiued therefore, who holde, that Chriſt according vnto
his humaine nature, can be at the ſame time both in heauen and in earth. And
thoſe alſo, who auouch that his fleſhe is euery where, and all thoſe in
a word, who bereaue his body of the eſſential, and as DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MASCEN ſpeaketh
of the Caracteriſtical properties ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; that is, ſuch as are markes of a
true bodie.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now, where as Chriſt after his Aſcention, was ſeen of
PAVL and STEPHEN; that viſion was extraordinary, and a peculier reuelation:
So that from thence it cannot bee gathered, that Chriſt was not in that place
wherevnto hee aſcended.</p>
            <p n="8">8 This Aſcention furthermore, was as it were, a certain
triumph after the victory gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer the enemies of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind which he
ouercame.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The end of this triumph is diuers and manifold: Firſt of
all, it teſtifieth, that the woorke of our Redemption was finiſhed vpon
earth, the which he would ſeale by this mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificall and royall triumph,
which for this cauſe is called by AVGVSTINE, a confirmation of the
Catholicall faith. For by this meanes Chriſt hath gotten, vnto the immortal
and incorruptible life, not an earthly, but an incorruptible and aeternall
manſion.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Secondly, that there ſhould be extant a moſt cleare
teſtimonie of the Diuinitie of Chriſt, by the which his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, was
taken vppon high, whence alſo it appeareth, <pb n="127" facs="tcp:1885:70"/> that he
conſiſteth of two natures.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Thirdlie, that hauing ouercome death, hee ſhould enjoy
that glorye, which was prepared and ordained for him before the foundation of
the world was laid; not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Deitie, but according to his
humanitie, the glory wherof appeared then, when a new ghueſt as it were,
entered into heauen; to wit, [the man GOD,] the which thing, the Angels had
neuer ſeene before.</p>
            <p n="12">12 And although the man Chriſt was glorified by his
Reſurrection, in ſuch ſort, as there was nothing wanting vnto him; yet
this Aſcention, was a more certaine ample poſſesſion of that glory.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Fourthly and laſtly, that he might prepare a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for vs in Heauen: and not onely prepare it, but alſo allure vs thither, that
wee might follow him by an ardent deſire and affection, while we are in this
life, and here vpon earth ſeeke thoſe things that are aboue.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Nowe, euen as Chriſt was borne for our cauſe, dead for
our cauſe, &amp;c. So hee aſcended into Heauen for our cauſe.</p>
            <p n="15">15 The fruit and profite therefore, which ariſeth to the
faithfull out of this Aſcention, is manifolde. For firſt, wee are thereby
vndoubtedly aſſured, that we ſhall once, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie at the laſt day,
aſcend alſo into Heauen; For where the head is, there the members alſo
ought to be, &amp; the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the members ſhall bee ſuch, as the
Aſcention of the head was (ſaue that he aſcended by his own power, where
as we ſhall aſcend, not by our owne, but by his vertue:) For our bodies
ought to bee faſhioned like vnto his glorious body, as the members vnto the
head.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Secondly, after this Aſcention, was the holy Ghoſt
giuen vnto the Apoſtles: Next, were other gifts from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen beſtowed vppon
men, and the Church furniſhed with things needfull for the ſame.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Thirdlye, heereby a way is opened for vs vnto our heauenly
countrey, from whence we fell by the meanes of ADAM.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Fourthly and laſtlie, his Reſurrection confirmeth 
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1885:71"/> our faith: For hereby we are aſſured, that our
ſoules ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from our bodies, euen before the Reſurrection, ſhall
paſſe to no other place, then where Chriſt is; that they may liue for
euer in bleſſednes with him.</p>

            <head>PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE SIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE
FATHER ALMIGHTIE. XLVII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 SEeing whole Chriſt, that is, Chriſt perſonally
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, or in reſpect that he is one ſubſiſting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is
ſaid to ſit, and that the action of ſitting, can not in the proper
ſignification thereof, agree vnto the Deitie in it ſelf: we muſt needs
conclude; that ſitting, properlie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, can in no wiſe agree vnto the
Deitie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And although, it may be properlie applied vnto that other
nature of Chriſt, which is corporall; in that ſenſe, that ſitting is
oppoſed vnto the ſtanding or the moouing of the bodie: yet wee muſt not
thinke, that that glorious bodie of his, though it be truly circumſcribed and
contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a place; doth either continually ſtand, ſit, or moue: For all
theſe things are groſſe and curious matters, neither are they ſo
particulerly to bee applied to the eſtate of that life.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That which is added concerning the right hand of God, is
much more to bee taken Figuratiuelie, as whereby thoſe thinges are attributed
vnto God, which are proper vnto man; ſeeing that God, who is without a bodie,
hath neither right ſide nor left, as beeing altogeather immeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and
infinite.</p>
            <p n="4">4 By this kinde of ſpeach therefore, being taken from the
cuſtome of Kings and Princes, who are wont to make a ſhewe vnto their
ſubjects of thoſe, whome they will haue to be in equall dignitie with them,
and by whome they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their gouernment, by placing them in a moſt
hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſeat; that is, at their right ſide, or at their left: by this 
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1885:71"/> kind of ſpeach, I ſay is meant, that Chriſt hath
receaued all power both in heauen and in earth, as he himſelfe the beſt
interpreter of his owne words doth expreſſe, MAT. 28.18.</p>
            <p n="5">5 This power as far as he is God, Coeternal with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
he receiued not firſt, after the reſurrection of his fleſh, but enjoyed
it from al aeternitie, common with his Father, of whome he receiued his
Sonne-hood from aeternitie.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Yet becauſe, not in himſelfe; diſtinctly conſidered
as far as he is God, but as far as he perſonally joyned to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the
forme of a ſeruant, ſubject vnto all our infirmities (ſin excepted) he
ſeemed in ſome ſort, vnto the time of his Aſcention, to haue caſt of
his owne Majeſtie (which in the Scriptures is expreſſed by the word of
Deſcending:) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he is alſo in the ſame reſpect, ſaid to bee
exalted vnto the right hand of the Father; or reſtored (as far as it
apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the manifeſting thereof) into the ſame Majeſtie, which
he had with the Father before all worlds.</p>
            <p n="7">7 There is another conſideration of his humain nature, the
which (hauing truly, and not in ſhewe, moſt powerfully accompliſhed the
office of his infirmitie) became Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ruler, and triumpher; and hath
gotten a perpetuall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment ouer all creatures, both for the preſeruation
of his, &amp; the perfecting by degrees the worke of their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;
alſo, for the vtter ouerthrow of his enemies, &amp; this is it that is ment
by his ſitting at the right hand of the father.</p>
            <p n="8">8 And euen as the hypoſtatical vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not therfore
diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, bicauſe the properties of the humanity ar diſtinctly
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed thervnto: euen ſo his glorification being diſtinctly
conſidered in the ſaid humanity, doth not infer that there ſhuld ether be
two chriſts, or ſitting at the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God</p>
            <p n="9">9 Yet is not the humanitye by this meanes made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with
the worde, either in ſubſtaunce (which is the proper error of EVTYCHES) or
in authority, as the Vbiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries do now hold: becauſe, that that
gouernment, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt as hee is man, hath all things ſubject to
himſelfe, as well in heauen, in earth, as vnder the earth, is limited within
the compaſſe of Creatures; excepting him ſaith the Apoſtle, who hath
made all things ſubject vnto him; that <pb n="130" facs="tcp:1885:72"/> is the Father,
with whome, as the WORD hath the one and the ſame eſſence from
aeternitie: ſo hath he the one and the ſame power fully in common with him,
in ſo much, that, the Fathers haue ſaid trulye, that Chriſt in reſpect
of this gouernment alſo, is both greater and leſſer then himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Falſe alſo and blaſphemous, is that Vbiquitary and
all preſent Majeſtie of the eſſentiall humanitie of Chriſt, which
they ſeeme to haue ſharpelie gathered from this ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the right
hand of the Father; for beſides that, by this meanes the truth of the fleſh
of Chriſt is manifeſtlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolliſhed: It is a fooliſh thing, to
reaſon from the power of his fleſh vnto the eſſence thereof: that is,
to holde that the eſſence of his humanitie, doth reach as farre as the
power thereof, where as the very faith of that Centurion, ſo much commended
by our Sauiour Chriſt, MATH. 8.10. doth on the contrarie ſide teach vs,
that it is meere folly to incloſe his power, within the bounds of his
eſſentiall preſence.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Now this kingdome &amp; gouernment, hath Chriſt
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie perfectlie obtained, as hauing gotten a name aboue all names: but in
his myſticall body, that is, in the church, it is but onely in ſome ſort
begun, neither ſhall it bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the ſaide bodie before that
laſt day, (when as all the enemies of Chriſts glorie, and our ſaluation
beeing ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally ouerthrowen and caſt downe) God ſhall bee all in all,
that is in his Saints; in whom now he is onely but ſome thing, whether we
reſpect them beeing a liue or dead.</p>
            <p n="12">12 That gouernement of Chriſt therefore, doth nowe
conſiſt in two things; that is, partly in the ſubduing both of his owne
children, and alſo of all their enemies; and partlie in bringing his, by
little and little to perfection by the power of his Spirite, and the
adminiſtration of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of his aeternall Prieſthoode; that is,
in the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of them, by his intercesſion with the Father, euen
vntill that he hath together with all his elect, celebrated an eternall
triumph.</p>
            <p n="13">13 This intercesſion of his, conſiſteth eſpecially in
that efficacie of that oblation of his, made once to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the force
whereof is this, that the Father looking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <pb n="131" facs="tcp:1885:72"/> all his
elect in his Sonne, by whoſe blood he is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto them, doth imbrace
them euermore with a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie affection: partly, in that as all the prayers
of the Saints, being as yet Pilgrimes here vpon earth, are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the
name of Chriſt: ſo hee preſenting himſelfe vnto his Father in heauen,
as the onelie Mediatour, doth ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe prayers, and make them
acceptable vnto God the Father.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Vnto theſe things is to bee adjoyned that ſtay and
defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which we haue by Chriſt, in that he hauing all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in his
hand, doth by what inſtrument and meanes he thinketh good, moſt powerfully
preſerue his Church, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueling as yet here vpon earth, againſt all the
furious inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of all whoſoeuer.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Touching this ſitting at the right hand of GOD the
Father, although in reſpect of the title thereof, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed vnto the
humanitie of Chriſt, from the verie firſt moment, of the perſonall
vniting thereof with the Deitie: yet both in regarde, that this humanitie was
to be throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down vnto the verie loweſt degree, for the performance of the
worke of our reconciliation, and alſo becauſe this glorification of our
head, was the crowne due vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience he yeelded for vs vnto the Father,
even vnto the death of the croſſe, therefore it fell not vnto him in deede
and poſesſion, before he had ſuffered, riſen againe, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
aboue all heauens.</p>
            <p>Hence it followeth that this errour alſo of the Vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitaries is
intollerable: namelie, in that they holde that this reall ſitting at the
right hand of the father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at the very firſt moment of the Lordes
incarnation: offending heerein two manner of wayes. Firſt, in the wrong
interpretation of this article: next in that they inuert the order of the
articles of the beleife, which ought neceſſarilie to be retained.</p>
            <p n="16">16 In aſmuch as the place of this ſitting is expreſlie
ſaid to be in heauen, and not vpon earth, or any where els, and that Chriſt
is not to depart from heauen before the laſt day: and alſo that he is
endued with a bodie, though <pb n="132" facs="tcp:1885:73"/> glorious, yet organical,
&amp; contained within the parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Therfore that reall preſence of his
vpon earth, is ſhewed to be falſe, againſt all Tranſubſtantiators and
Conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiators, euen by this ſitting of his in heauen, at the right

vnto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer we adjoine which thinges appertaine vnto the ful
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of this gouernment.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Chriſtian Faith therefore dooth teach, that Chriſt who
ſtriueth with his enemies, vntill the nomber of all thoſe that were giuen
him of the Father be finiſhed, &amp; the time appointed for the executing of
Gods wrath againſt Sathan, his Angels, and the world, be expired, ſhall
come again from heauen and execute his full power, both in the finall deliuerie
of all his children, &amp; in the vtter ouerthrow of all his enemies.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The vniuerſall reſtitution of the world, which is
ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtlie deſired of all the creatures themſelues in generall, ſhall
ſerue for the ſetting forward of the ſaluation of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But it is curious and prophane to enquire what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1885:73"/> of the reſtitution that ſhall bee, any farther then
the word of God doth reueale it.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Now that that judgement, whereunto all men, ſome to be
whollie abſolued, others to be whollie condemned, ſhall be ſubject, is to
be Vniuerſall and euerlaſting, may be proued by arguments drawne from
humane reaſon, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from that very principle, whereby the wicked go
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to diſplace Gods prouidence: namely, that God muſt needes bee
juſt, and therefore that it cannot bee, but it ſhould aeternallie go well
with the good, and euill with the bad.</p>
            <p n="6">6 But the vndoubted proofes of this article, as alſo of all
the reſt, are to be fetched from Gods word.</p>
            <p>We do condemne therefore the Epicures, who denie Gods prouidence, as
though the caſuall (as they call it) ſucceſsion and change of things were
to continue for euer. The Platonikes, who granting the world to haue had a
beginning, do yet teach that it ſhall neuer haue an end. The Ariſtotelians,
who dreame that the world nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had a beginning, nor euer ſhall haue an
end. And all other mockers, who think that there ſhall neuer bee anie
judgement, becauſe it is ſo long differred as PETER ſetteth downe 2. PET.
3.3. Yet doe wee not ground our ſelues in this point, vpon the opinion of the
Stoickes, who taught by naturall reaſon, that the world ſhoulde bee
conſumed with fire, but vpon the authoritie of the word.</p>
            <p n="7">7 This judgement in regarde of the power and decree thereof,
is jointlie of the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt: but the
promulgating and execution of the ſame, is committed to the Sonne, &amp; that
in his humaine nature: In the which nature it pleaſeth the Father mediatly to
rule all creatures.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Chriſt therefore ſhall come from heauen in his true,
viſible and finite bodie: yet cloathed with that Diuine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and
majeſtie, whereby he hath gotten a name aboue all names.</p>
            <p>That dotage therefore of the Vbiquitaries, is moſt 
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1885:74"/> vaine, who do oppoſe the majeſtie of Chriſts
fleſh, vnto his locall and organicall circumſcription: and doe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a
double reall preſence of his bodie, the one viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and finite, which is
of his diſpenſation: the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible and infinite, which they call
omni-majeſticall, which cannot bee grounded vppon anie place of the word.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Before the tribunall ſeat of this Iudge ſhall all men
without exception, that euer were ſince the beginning of the world, ſtand
to be judged.</p>
            <p n="10">10 All therefore that haue beene dead ſhall bee joined
again to their bodies, and as for thoſe that ſhall be found aliue, they
ſhalbe chaunged in a moment, to the end that ſome of them may enjoy that
bleſſed &amp; perpetuall felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with Chriſt their head: others that
they may be adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto euerlaſting tormentes, which Sathan their head and
his wicked Angels, and ſo Chriſt may trulie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie raigne for
euer.</p>
            <p>Wee condemne therefore the opinion of ORIGEN, and of the
Chiliaſts, who held that all men ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued after a thouſand
yeares.</p>
            <p n="11">11 This judgement ſhall Chriſt exerciſe, in reſpect
of the elect, both according to the law which hee hath fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for them: and
alſo according to the Goſpell which was giuen vnto them, that they ſhould
embrace the ſame with a true and a liuelie faith: and in regard of the
wicked, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the lawe onelie, which purſueth euerie man with
aeternall puniſhment: and therefore alſo hee ſhall crowne the one of
them, being acquired throw his meere fauour, and ſhall puniſh the other in
juſt ſeueritie.</p>
            <p>We refuſe therefore, both thoſe who attribute the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of
aeternall life, vnto the ſatisfactorie and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious works of men: &amp;
them alſo, who aſcribe the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the wicked, vnto a kinde of
abſolute and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne power that is in God, beyond the judgement of the
law.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Chriſt ſhall then yeeld the kingdome vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that is, ſhall abſolutelie performe in deed the office <pb n="135" facs="tcp:1885:74"/> which he receiued of the Father: and the Father on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide,
ſhall performe vnto him, together with his, that aeternall triumphe
promiſed vnto him, when hee hath put all his enemies vnder his feet.</p>
            <p n="13">13 The place and the time of this judgement, hath God
manifeſted vnto none, but would retaine the knowledge therof vnto himſelf,
both that he might contain vs watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in our duties, leſt that either we
ſhould be aſtoniſhed with fear, or abuſe the deferring of his comming;
and alſo, that he might exerciſe our faith and patience: yet hath he
foretolde vs, MAT. 24. the ſignes that go before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; ſo that none
can be on the ſodaine ouertaken ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, ſaue onely thoſe, who wittingly
and willingly remaine vnprouided.</p>
            <p>They are therefore worthie to be reprehended in the Church, who
preſume to ſet downe the time thereof, by the aſpects of the Starres, or
vpon ſome imaginarie ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions or Propheſies.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Nowe the Lorde according vnto his ſecrete wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
dooth deferre that day, partly, that the number of his elect may bee
finiſhed; and partly, that the wicked may be made more and more
vnexcuſable.</p>
            <p n="15">15 That laſt vniuerſall judgement hindreth not, but that
the Lorde may in the meane time execute his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar judgements in this
life, either vppon his elect for their ſaluation, or vpon the reprobate for
their vndoing; neither doth it alſo hinder, but that hee may after their
departure gather the ſoules of his elect, into that bleſſed life, and
tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſpirit of the wicked in the priſons that are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en vnto
himſelf, even vntil the time that he accompliſheth the full happines of the

            <p n="16">16 And euen as he would haue his laſt comming to be hidden
from men, ſo alſo hee would haue the time of their death for the very

IN THE HOLY GHOST. XLIX.</head>
            <p n="1">1 VVE doe in this Article confeſſe, that the holy Ghoſt
as being the third perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, is to bee adored and worſhipped
by the ſame faith and inuocation, whereby, in the former Articles wee haue
confeſſed, that the Father and the Son, beeing in order the firſt
perſons of the Trinitie, ar diſtinctly to be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and
worſhipped.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The holy Ghoſt in this place doth ſignifie, that
eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall power, who is eſſentially ſubſiſting in the Father
and the Son, proceeding and diſtinguiſhed equally from them both, in regard
of the manner of his being: but in reſpect of his eſſence, abſolutely
conſidered, hee is GOD, hauing that Deitie which is not deriued by
propagation from an other Godhead, but is one, moſt ſingle, and of
himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now, ſeing the Father neither can be ſeparated from his
Co-aeternall and Co-eſſentiall wiſedome, neither co-eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall
power, who is the holy Ghoſt, can be ſeuered from that wiſedome, but doth
depend of the Father, and of his wiſedome: there is no queſtion to bee
made, but that hee doth proceed from the Father and the Sonne, as from one
cauſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Where the Sonne is ſaide to bee begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the holy Ghoſt affirmed, to proceede from the Father and the Sonne; it
ſheweth a difference between the wiſdome that remaineth in the Deitie, and
the power, that doth outwardlie ſhew it ſelfe by the effects.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That which both the Schoole-men, and alſo the
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt Diuines amongeſt the Latines, haue written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the holy
Ghoſt, as being a kinde of eſſentiall loue, knitting the Father; the
Sonne togeather, hath brought in to religion, many intricate, ſtrange, and
dangerous queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:1885:75"/>6 Although the works of the Trinitie,
which they call outward or externall, are inſeparable: yet in the effecting
of them, there is a diſtinction to bee obſerued, not onely of the
perſons, but alſo of the perſonall actions.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The proper operation of the holie Ghoſt, is to effect in
deed in his time and manner, thoſe things which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath determined
to diſpoſe by his Sonne, that is his aeternall wiſedome, and to execute
by the power of them both, that is, by the holie Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Yet are we not to thinke that the holie Ghoſt dooth worke
anie thing with the Father and the Sonne, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall or a
miniſteriall cauſe, but without anie inae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie, and immediatlie in
reſpect of them both, worketh all things together with them.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The power thereof did then ſhew it ſelfe, when as the
world was to be created of nothing, and afterward in his prouidence, whereby he
hath vnto this day, and euer ſhall as long as the world ſtandeth,
preſerue the ſame, both by ordinary and extraordinarie meanes.</p>
            <p n="10">10 The effect thereof furthermore, is to woorke in the harts
of men, which is done manie wayes: for ſome he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth apt and readie to
practiſe morall vertues, not by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, but by repreſsing their naturall
corruption: &amp; others by his eſpeciall power hee doth make meete to
vnderſtand and bring to paſſe, great matters, all which doe properlie
ſerue for the conſeruation of mans ſocietie, although that the effects of
theſe guiftes are otherwhiles alſo behoofull vnto the Church.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Sometimes alſo he goeth farther, in beſtowing vpon
ſome the knowledge of his heauenlie truth, with other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
guifts, as of Propheſie and healing: to be brief he doth after a ſort,
ſometimes enlighten not the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding onlie, but euen the will of
ſome, who yet are ſo in the Church, as it will one day appeare, that they
were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer true members thereof.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Now his ſauing power, doth onelie manifeſt it ſelfe,
both in the congregation of his elect, and alſo in euerye particular member
of his myſticall bodie: whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <pb n="138" facs="tcp:1885:76"/> to
paſſe, that the Church alone is holie, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers onlie, properlie
called Saints.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Hee dooth therefore in part beſtowe the very ſame
guifts vpon his elect, whereof ſome of the reprobates are partakers: but
adioyning thereunto the grace of a good conſcience, and of perſeuerance. So
the holie Prophetes and Apoſtles in times paſt, haue left vnto vs by the
inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holie Ghoſt, the ſcriptures, contained in the bookes
of the olde and new Teſtament. After this manner alſo, manie haue beene
indued with the guift of woorking miracles, and all faithfull Paſtors and
Teachers, haue bene in all ages, beſtowed vpon the Church, and indued with
neceſſarie guifts.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Now the guifts, whereby the holy Ghoſt doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie
diſtinguiſh the church from the world; are thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentant guifts
which hee beſtoweth onlie vpon his elect: namelie, the effectuall enlightning
of their minde, and the guift of perſeuerance: the effect whereof is true
faith, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Chriſt with all his benefites, vnto the ſaluation of
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one that beleeueth ſeuerallie: whereunto is vnſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie joined
ſanctification, whereby wee are drawne ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cearlie to loue God, and our

            <p n="15">15 That worke which was the moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al other:

            <head>PRINCIPLES VPPON THE ARTICLE, I BELEEVE THAT THERE IS A HOLY
CATHOLICK CHVRCH. L.</head>
            <p n="1">1 OMitting in this place, the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whether there be a
Church or no, as an vnneceſſarie point; we will rather ſee what the
Church is.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The word CHVRCH taken from the common cuſtome of publick
affaires, where the people beeing called by the voice of a cryer, did meet
together, began euen from the verie time of the Apoſtles, (the name of
Sinagogues being left vnto the Iewiſh conuentions,) to be applied vnto their
meetings, who embracing the voice of the Goſpell, were wont to haue publick
aſſemblies for the vſe of Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now the thing it ſelf ſignified by this word, is drawn
farther: that is, to expreſſe the companie of thoſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed
vp from the fall of mankinde by the mercifull voice of God, haue, and will vnto
the end of the worlde, conſent together in the profeſsion of his true
worſhip.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Nowe, in aſmuch as all thoſe who haue giuen their names
to bee of this meeting, haue not either doone the ſame vnfainedlie, or
ſhewed that conſtancie that had bene meet; by reaſon that Sathan neuer
ceaſeth to ſowe tares in the field of the Lord: Hence it came to paſſe
that men haue beene alwaies enforced to take the Church ſometimes in a more
generall, ſometimes in a more ſpeciall ſignification.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The Church therefore is generallie called, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of all thoſe, who profeſſe true Religion, whether they do it vnfainedlie
and perſeuere therein, or hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie and fall away from the ſame. In
ſpeciall, it is taken for all thoſe onelie, whome God of his infinite
mercie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <pb n="140" facs="tcp:1885:77"/> elected before all worldes, doth
effectuallie call, when he thinketh good, in ſuch ſort, as they being
endued with true faith, and perſeuering vnto the end, may be juſtlie
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be of Gods flock.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Hence ſprung that diſtinction of the viſible and
inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church: of the viſible, which is ſo accounted by the notes of
the outward profeſsion, without any differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the faithfull and
the cloſe hypocrites: of the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, which is reſtrained vnto thoſe
onelie, who trulie and conſtantlie beleeue to the end, &amp; therfore called
inuiſible, becauſe true faith can aſſuredly be diſcerned by none,
ſaue by the Lord, and them in whome it is.</p>
            <p n="7">7 This inuiſible Church is only one, as there is but one God
the Father, one Chriſt the Mediatour and head of his myſticall bodie, one
faith, one hope by the holy Ghoſt, and one aeternall life: and it is
therefore called Catholicke; that is, vniuerſall, both becauſe it hath
bene, is, and ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the one and the ſame: and alſo, becauſe
GOD hath alwaies gathered them into one bodye, out of all ſorts of men and
people, as it ſeemeth good vnto his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; whereas, before the comming of
Chriſt, the Church was particularly called out of the nation of the Iewes
one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
            <p n="8">8 And although, God for many ages, had ſeperated the
Gentiles (whome the Apoſtles therefore affirmeth to bee without God, &amp;
ſtrangers from the couenant of grace) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſeed of ABRAHAM, yet was
there almoſt no age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he called not ſome of the Gentiles, vntill
that the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion-wall being broken by the preaching of the Apoſtles, that
promiſe made vnto ABRAHAM was accompliſhed: namely, that all the nations
ſhould be bleſſed in his ſeede: becauſe they were to become ABRAHAMS
ſeed by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The particuler aſſemblies of this bodie, diſpearſed
throughout the world, conſidered either generallie or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie, as it is
viſible or inuiſible, are as it were the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that make vp one
myſticall body.</p>
            <p n="10">10 And this is that Catholicke Church, whereof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is
made in the beliefe; therfore called holie, becauſe it <pb n="141" facs="tcp:1885:77"/>
is by the holy Ghoſt ſeperated from the reſt of the worlde, and
conſecrated vnto God.</p>
            <p n="11">11 This ſame Church is rightly deuided into the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
and Triumphant: By the Militant, is vnderſtood the company of the true
beleeuing, yet remaining vppon the earth, and ſtriuing with Sathan and the
remnants of their fleſhe: By the Triumphant, are meant thoſe, whoſe
bleſſed Spirits are already gathered vnto the Lord, euen vntil both the one
and the other, at that glorious comming of Chriſt hauing receiued their
glorious bodies, ſhall triumph with Chriſt their head for euermore.</p>
            <p n="12">12 That holines, wherby this Catholick Church, which is
alſo inuiſible in that ſenſe that we haue ſpoken, is ſeuered from
the world, if it be conſidered in reſpect of the puritie of the doctrine of
the truth, is altogeather without ſpot or wrinckle: Or if it be conſidered,
not as it is in it ſelfe, but according vnto the beliefe that is yeelded vnto
this true and wholſome doctrine: we holde againe, that the force of that
truth is ſo great, that it is alwaies declared and obeied in the Church
vniuerſally conſidered. Wherefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calleth the Church taken
in this ſenſe, the piller and ground of truth.</p>
            <p n="13">13 But if the Church be reſpected, not vniuerſally, but
particularlie; that is, according as it hath diuers aſſemblies here and
there gathered togeather, then indeed it may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten come to paſſe, that
ſome particular Churches may err, yea, in ſome fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal points, either
in part or in whole, yet ſo, as the elect do alwaies returne vnto the way:
nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can thoſe particular ſpottes, that cleaue vnto it for a time, make
the vniuerſal church to leeſe her naturall beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p n="14">14 We confeſſe (to ſpeake nothing here of the
corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners) that this may come to paſſe, much more, if wee
ſeuerally conſider the members of particuler Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; for ſuch is the
weaknes of mans judgement, euen in the deare Saints of God, that you cannot
find any, ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the perfect knowledge of the trueth, but hee doth
ſtagger in ſome things; eſpecially, when the Lord being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked 
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1885:78"/> by the ſinnes of men, doth giue efficacie and force
vnto the ſpirit of error.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Although, that the Catholicke Church can neuer fall away
from the truth, yet both the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, together with the holy
ſtorie in generall, both before and after the comming of Chriſt, haue
foretolde, and theſe very times wherein wee liue doe teſtifie, that it hath
often come to paſſe, that the greateſt part of particuler churches and
men, falling away, yea, and ſtriuing againſt the truth: the light of the
Church ſeemed for a time, though not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie, yet in a manner to be cleane
extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The true markes therefore of the viſible Church, can not
bee the multitude, or perſonall ſuccesſion, but the doctrine truly taught
out of the written word of God, and the lawfull adminiſtration (that is,
ſuch as is agreeable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods ordinance) of the Sacraments, to wit, of
Baptiſme and of the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Theſe two notes doe depend vpon the lawful forme (that
is, ſuch as is preſcribed in Gods worde) of the holie Miniſterie,
conſtituted as it ought to be: But in aſmuch as the Church ſometimes is
brought to that paſſe, that not onely Wolues doe ſupplie the place of
lawfull Paſtors; but alſo, the whole forme of the ordinarie Miniſterie,

Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, being for a time altogeather broken of, the church is
extraordinarilie fed, as it were in the wildernes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is not this

vpon earth.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Now whereſoeuer the Doctrine of the Apoſtles is
taught, ther is no queſtion to be made, but that the church is there, though
there bee fewe that giue eare vnto the ſame with fruit.</p>
            <p n="19">19 That therefore is a true Church, be it vniuerſall, or
particuler, which heareth the worde of God contained in the writinges of the
Prophetes and the Apoſtles; in ſuche ſort, as it canne adde nothing
therevnto, detract nothing from the ſame, nor chaunge anie thing therein,

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1885:78"/> that appertain vnto the foundation of the gouernment of
the Church: &amp; as for the hard places that are in the word, it interpreteth

            <head>PRINCIPLES VPON THE ARTICLE, I BELEEVE THAT THERE IS A COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVNION
OF SAINCTS. LI.</head>
            <p n="1">1 CHriſt can be fruitfull vnto none, but by
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This participation is partly of Chriſt, and partlie of of
his benefites, which doe flow from the participation of him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That therefore, whereof wee are made partakers, is partly
ſubſtantiall, and partly a quality.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The Subſtantial things, are both Chriſt himſelfe God
and man, and alſo all thoſe corporall things which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon vs,
together with Chriſt, beeing participated vnto vs. The qualities are all
thoſe gifts, both of the bodie and the mind, which in him we receaue in this
life, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in the life to come.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Now wee are made partakers of the Deitie of Chriſt, onely
in force and operation, but of his humanity in verie deed, as far as he is our
brother.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Nowe this participation, by reaſon of the moſt ſtrait
ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and the vnſpeakable efficacie therof (not that the one ſubſtance
doth touch the other) is expreſſed by the names of vnion, engraffing,
incorporation, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The ſame is for three cauſes called ſpirituall:
firſt of all, becauſe the true and the ſoueraigne cauſe thereof, is
that power, and vnſpeakable force of the holy Ghoſt, the which,
notwithſtanding the diſtaunce of place, doth moſt trulie, and moſt
effectually joyne the Saints, (though here as yet vpon earth) in a ſpiritual
marriage with Chriſt, that they may be fleſh of his fleſh, &amp; bone of
his bones; althogh according vnto this fleſh, they are not vpon earth, but in
heauen.</p>
            <p>8 Secondly, becauſe again this conjunction with Chriſt
himſelf, according to the fleſh is (in regard of vs,) a worke, not of the
bodie, but of the minde, which receiueth Chriſt by faith.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:1885:79"/>9 Thirdly, becauſe the end and the
ſcope of this mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Communion is not to the end, that a kind of
monſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bodie, ſhould ariſe from the vniting of his ſubſtaunce
with ours, but that in this life, we ſhuld be gouerned by his Spirit, and
that in the life to come, we ſhould liue an aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and a heauenly life
with him.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Yet may this vniting, bee called a corporall vnion in a
ſound meaning; ſo that, all ambiguitie and newnes of wordes be auoyded:
namely, if that eſpeciall thing, which in this myſterie, (as before hath
bin ſaid) we ſpiritually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by faith (and that is the verie humanitie
of Chriſt) be conſidered: Next, if reſpect be had to the external means,
which the holy Ghoſt vſeth, to beget and nouriſh faith in vs; namely,
both the outward word ſounding in our ears, and alſo, the Sacramentall
elements and rites, that affect the reſt of our ſenſes.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Out of this ſpirituall vnion, ariſeth that myſticall
bodie, wherof Chriſt is the head, both in reſpect of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence ouer
the ſame, and alſo, becauſe he doth who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie giue ſenſe and motion
therevnto. Nowe, all thoſe that beleeue and are ſanctified, are called
members vnder this head; in which ſenſe is the Church called by PETER, the
Citie, &amp; the ſpirituall temple of God, built of liuely ſtones; whoſe
foundation and cheife corner ſtone is Chriſt, who ſuſtaineth and
beareth vp the whole building.</p>
            <p>It is no leſſe abſurd therefore to ſuppoſe, that there is
a kind of faſtning, and a cleauing of Chriſts bodie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ours, or of
ours within his; then it were to ſay, that the bodies of the Saints do
ſubſiſt one within another: Seeing that the band of the Communion of
Saints, is the very ſame that the vnion is, which they haue, both with
themſelues, and with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Some of thoſe things, wherof we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in
this myſterie, are altogeather proper to the elect: namelie, Chriſt
himſelfe, (of whome none can be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, except he be indued with true
faith:) true faith, which is inſeparablie joyned with true hope; charitie:
and laſt of all, that aeternall kingdome prepared from all aeternity,
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1885:80"/> to the free purpoſe of God vnto the elect
onelie: Some alſo are after a ſort, as the Lord thinketh good, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to
the hypocrites and prophane, by reaſon that they ſeeme to bee ingraffed
into Chriſt, as are the gifts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, of tongues, and of healing,
togeather with manie other notable gifts of the mind, and excellent benefites
of this life: the which, as by the elect they are conſecrated to God, who is
the giuer of them; ſo are they prophaned by the wicked.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Againe, theſe gifts (though not alwaies in the ſame
meaſure) are partly common to all the Saints, as beeing neceſſarie to the
ſaluation of all (of which ſort are the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Chriſt
himſelfe, liuelie faith, ſteadfaſt hope, loue vnfained, remisſion of
ſinnes, and ſanctification by the holie Ghoſt, with ſuche like) and
partlye, proper to euerie ſeuerall beleeuer; the which, the ſame holie
Spirite doth diſtribute according to the diuers conſideration of the
callings of men, vnto whome, and in what meaſure hee thinketh good.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Euerie one of the Saints ſeuerallie conſidered, haue
their peculier giftes, both in regarde of the poſſesſion of Chriſt
himſelfe, and alſo of his benefits, as it is expreſſed in the
ſimilitude of the talents. But in aſmuch as there is one GOD and Father of
all, one Chriſt the Lord, one Spirite, whereof all the Saints are endued, one
faith, one hope of the ſame calling, one baptiſme, one kingdome of heauen:
and alſo, becauſe whatſoeuer graces beſtowed vpon anie, is therefore
giuen, that the vſe of them may bee common vnto them all, and ſo, that they
ſhould be the one and the ſelfe ſame bodie of Chriſt: therefore all the
gifts beſtowed vppon any of the elect in particuler, are common vnto all the
Saints, in reſpect of the vſe, which is the communion of Saints in this
life.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Yea, and the vſe of theſe graces, (if it may be) ought
to reach euen vnto them that are without, as farre as the glorie of God, and
the edification of the Church doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, both becauſe often times, many of
the elect lie hid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and alſo, becauſe wee muſt bee like
our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1885:80"/> Father, who maketh his Sunn to riſe vpon
the good and bad.</p>
            <p n="16">16 This Communion, begun here vpon earth, ſhal then (after
that thoſe thinges which belong vnto the vſe of this life are abolliſhed)
be perfected in that aeternall kingdom, when as faith being chaunged into a
full knowledge, hope into the injoying of the thinges hoped for, and charitie
being made perfect, God ſhall be all in all his Saints.</p>
            <p>Now the Communion of Merites, either amongſt the Saints liuing
heere togeather, or betweene the Militant and the Triumphant church, is both
moſt falſe, and alſo blaſphemous, as alſo, the very opinion of
merrites, is a meere forged vntruth.</p>

            <head>PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE WORD OF GOD. LII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 VVE haue dealt in the former principles with the Church, and
it hath bene ſaid that the notes of the true Church, were the Word of God,
and the Sacraments: now wee will deale with theſe notes; and firſt of all
with the former of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The word of God (which is the firſt note) wee cal in this
place, not whatſoeuer GOD hath ſpoken, but thoſe things onlie, which the
Prophetes and Apoſtles, inſpired by Gods Spirite, haue in times paſt as
taught by worde, ſo committed to writing: &amp; thoſe things, which being
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the bookes of the ould and new Teſtament, are as yet vnto
this day, after ſo manie warres, ſlaughters, &amp; ouerthrowes, extant in
Gods Church: in which bookes God hath declared both what he will haue vs to
know co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, and what is to be done of vs.</p>
            <p n="3">3 God onelie is to bee acknowledged the authour of theſe
bookes, whence the whole Scripture is ſaid by PAVL to bee giuen by the
inſpiration of God: and is alſo called <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1885:81"/> the word of
God. And therefore it is vnlawfull to call into queſtion, or to refuſe anie
thing that is contained therein: as alſo to bring in anie thing that is not
written in the ſame.</p>
            <p>Deteſtable therefore was that peruerſnes of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites,
Manichaees, the Valentinians, and of all ſuch as refuſed either all, or
ſome of the bookes of the newe Teſtament.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Theſe writings by the ſingular prouidence of God haue
long ſince beene brought by the Church, into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine order and Cannon,
that they might bee diſcerned from counterfaite, yea, and all other bookes:
and that they ſhould bee a rule of faith and obedience, that ſhould haue
credite of it ſelf, and hence they are called Cannonicall. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bookes,
whoſoeuer haue beene the authours of them, though they contain manie
wholſome &amp; profitable things are yet but accounted the writings of
priuate men, neither haue they their credite of themſelues, but as far as
they agree with the former bookes, and no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>They therefore both haue, and at this day doe moſt greuouſlie
offend, who take away this difference, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the bookes of the
APOCRYPHA are to haue no leſſe credite in the eſtabliſhing of Religion,
then the Cannonical Scripture, of which number are the Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
conſpiratours.</p>
            <p n="5">5 This Scripture we acknowledge to be cannonicall, and
authentick, not ſo much by the common conſent of the Church, as by the
teſtimonie of the Spirite of God, who teacheth vs, that they are to be
embraced, as beeing moſt vndoubtedlie true, and ſuch as haue proceeded from
Gods own mouth.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Now, theſe holie books do whollie containe al thoſe
thinges, that are needfull for our ſaluation, in ſomuch that it is
altogether vnlawfull to exſpect for anie ſupplie of this doctrine: for the
Scripture (as PAVLE doth expreſlie teach) is able to make the man of God
abſolute.</p>
            <p>Moſt greeuous therefore is their errour, who thinke that the
liuelie and the ſauing knowledge of God, is to <pb n="149" facs="tcp:1885:81"/> be
elſe where ſought, then in the written word: and doe therefore thruſt
vnto vs, their vnwritten falſhoods: out of the which they will haue
neceſſarie arguments to bee drawne in the cauſe of faith and
religion.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The naturall and proper interpretation of this holy
Scripture, is to be drawne from the analogie of faith, and the conference of
places. For that which is darcklie in one place, is in an other clearelie
taught, that which heere is ſhortlie, is elſewhere largelie ſet down, and
ſo the Woord is the rule and the interpretour of it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>They are deceauers therefore, who ſay, that the right and
authoritie of expounding the worde of God, is in their power, as though it were
lawfull for them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret anie place as they think good.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Neither are the expoſitions of auncient Doctors to bee
receaued as vndoubted, anie farther then they agree with the truth: for PAVLE
doth command vs, that we giue eare or conſent vnto none, whoſoeuer he be,
that teacheth anie other doctrine.</p>
            <p>Wee cannot allow therefore of their opinion, who wil haue the
interpretation of the fathers, (as they call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to haue credite of
themſelues.</p>
            <p n="9">9 It is true indeed, that ſome places of the Scripture
remaine euen vnto this day, ſo obſcure and hard to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, as the
verie beſt and moſt faithfull interpretours haue not agreed among
themſelues, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but in theſe things, euery man is
to acknowledge his owne ignorance, ſluggiſhnes, or ſome other fault: and
the Scripture is ſo plentifull, that the one and the ſelfe ſame place,
can admit diuers interpretations, and yet all agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the doctrine of
faith.</p>
            <p n="10">10 This notwithſtanding is moſt certaine, that the
grounds and neceſſarie heades of Chriſtian Religion, are ſo clearely
ſet downe by the Prophets and Apoſtles, as (the Spirite of God woorking in
the Saincts) they are manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlie perceaued in the Church. And therefore wee
doe not agree vnto them, who thinke the Scripture ſo obſcure, as it needeth
to be made cleare by ſome other light. Nowe, <pb n="150" facs="tcp:1885:82"/> this light
they will haue without exception to bee drawne from that pretended Catholick
Church: that is, either from the fathers, from the Synods, or from ſome long
cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of time: as though the Scripture had not beene vnderſtood, before
either the Fathers, or the Synodes were.</p>
            <p n="11">11 This Word of God is to be dailie meditated vppon, and all
men of what eſtate ſoeuer they bee, ought moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlie to read the
ſame: for no man is to be bereaued of that meanes, whereby hee is to be
inſtructed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the ſure way of his ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Wee cannot therefore but condemne the Papiſtes in this point
alſo, who holde it vnlawfull for laie-men (as they call them) to employ
themſelues in the reading of the Word.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Now that the vnlearned and vnskilfull may with fruit bee
conuerſant in the reading heereof: it is needfull that the Bible be
tranſlated into the mother tongue of all Chriſtian people. Therefore wee
doe alſo condemne the ſaid Papiſts, who will not allow of ſuch
tranſlations.</p>
            <p n="13">13 This ſame word of God, ought to be faithfully and
ſincearlie expounded vnto the people, by euerie Paſtour: and out of the
ſame are exhortations, conſolations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions to be drawne:
whence alſo the gainſayer is to be conuinced and put to ſilence.</p>
            <p n="14">14 This worde of GOD is ſaid to haue life in it: not that
this life is placed in the letters, ſyllables or wordes: (for they are to be
counted witches and enchanters, who attribute anie deuine power vnto the
letters and woordes themſelues) but becauſe it is an inſtrument, whereby
God doth make knowne vnto vs, that which he will haue vs to vnderſtand for
our ſaluation.</p>
            <p n="15">15 To conclude, this is an abſolute, perpetuall and
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie note of the Church: namely, that the purity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be
maintained therin, and that the pillar &amp; ground of the truth be in the
ſame.</p>

            <head>PRINCIPLES CONCERNING TRADITIONS. LIII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 HAuing laſt of al diſputed concerning the written Worde
of God, this preſent Treatiſe is to bee touching Traditions, which ſome
call by the name of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written word and doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Thoſe which the Greek cal
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are commonly called Traditions
amongſt the Latines: which they affirme not to bee contained in writing, but
to haue beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied by word of mouth, &amp; as it were, from hand to hand
deliuered from one to an other.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now, there are two ſorts of Traditions mentioned in the
Scriptures, whereof ſome are commendable, as proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Spirit of
God, of which ſort are thoſe which are mentioned to haue beene receaued
from Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles: others were inuented by the wit of man, as
thoſe which Chriſt calleth the Traditions of the Fathers, and the
commandements and doctrines of men.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The former of theſe were not at the firſt, as being in
the infancy of the church, committed to writing: but now, ſince that time,
that they haue beene put into the writings of the Apoſtles, they are not to
be taken as vnwritten, but to haue credit amongſt all, as being the verie
written word of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Of theſe there are two ſorts: for ſome do appertaine
vnto the record of the hyſtorie, and the things that were done, as that which
LVKE ſpeaketh cap. 1. 2. of the things that were done by Chriſt: ſome do
appertaine vnto doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and that in a twofold difference.</p>
            <p n="6">6 For ſome were concerning the Doctrine it ſelfe, as
thoſe things touching the Lords Supper, which PAVL affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue
deliuered, as he receiued them of the Lord: Some are concerning the rites and
the good order of the Church; as that touching the blood of thinges that were
ſtrangled, the couering of womens heads, that men ſhould 
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1885:83"/> not bee couered in the time of praier, and ſuch
like.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Thoſe thinges, which are concerning the ſubſtaunce of
doctrine, are to be perpetually obſerued in the Church: but as for the things
which apertain to outward rites, they in conſideration of diuers
circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, as of time, place, &amp; perſon may bee chaunged: yet ſo,
as regard be alwaies had (which muſt be generally obſerued in al
indifferent things) vnto that which maketh moſt for the glorie of God, &amp;
the aedification of the Church.</p>
            <p n="8">8 As touching other traditions which haue riſen from the
bare will of man, though they haue neuer ſo glorious a ſhewe of antiquitie,
holines and wiſedome; yet if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not with Gods word, they are to be
accounted for no better then will-worſhip, and ſo they are to be vtterlie
caſt out, with all other ſuperſtitions, that are either directlie or
indirectlie againſt Gods word. Of this ſort, are the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations of the
difference of meat, garments, &amp; daies, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the dead, invocation of
Saints departed, Mouckery, ſingle life, and a thouſand ſuch like; either
fooliſh or impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous toyes, wherewith Chriſtians are now much more
bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, then the Iewes were in times paſt with their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
            <p n="9">9 For in the worſhippe of God, this hath bene, is, and
ſhall be the onely rule: Whatſoeuer is without faith is ſin; and that
faith dependeth not vpon the inuentions of men, but vpon the hearing of Gods
worde; and that there can be no obedience, where there is no commandement.</p>
            <p n="10">10 And ſeeing the minde of the Lord, is onely knowen vnto
himſelfe, it belongeth not vnto man to ſet downe, what is acceptable, or
what is odious in his ſight, but vnto God onely; who hath therefore taught
vs, how hee will be worſhipped, and would not leaue that point to our
choiſe.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The word of God furthermore, is euery way perfect, and
thervnto nothing is to be added or detracted; for it is able to make the man of
God abſolute. Wherefore, we do conſtantly affirme, that we are bound onely
to cleaue vnto it, rightly vnderſtoode; and that wee muſt not depart one
jote from the ſame. The vnderſtanding of it, is to be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1885:83"/> from the analogie of faith, and the conferences of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="12">12 We hould, that it is lawfull neither for counſellors,
nor Biſhops, nor for anie man to impoſe lawes vppon the conſciences of
men, which onelie belongeth to the alone Biſhop of our ſoules, and our
Law-giuer Chriſt, or vnto the Apoſtles, hauing his commaundement. For,
although true Paſtors and Doctors of the Church, haue beene and are in the
place of the Apoſtles, yet haue not they the ſame commiſsion that the
Apoſtles had. For the Apoſtles being immediatlie inſpired by the
ſpirite of God, could not erre, and we are bound in euerie point to beleeue
them. But as for Paſtors and Teachers, they may (ſuch is mans
weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) oftentimes ſlipp, and therefore they are onelie to be
followed, ſo farre as they followe Chriſt and his Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</p>
            <p>Wee condemne therefore the olde Phariſies, and thoſe which haue
followed them, as the Iewes, who haue coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vs their CABALA, and manie
other dotages of their TALMVD: the Papiſts, and all other falſe
Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who haue polluted the ſeruice of God, with their own dreames
and inuentions, and as it is written, ISAY 29. MAT. 15. doe worſhip God in

               <p n="1">1 VVE haue ſhewed in the former treatiſe, what the
authoritie of Traditions can be: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that wee entreat of thoſe
thinges which appertaine vnto the confirmation of them: wherefore wee will
firſt of all deale with counſels, next with Fathers.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Seeing all things in the Church of God, ought to be done
orderlie, and that the Church is gathered out of all <pb n="154" facs="tcp:1885:84"/>
people and nations, the parts as it were of the Catholicke or vniuerſal
church, were not without cauſe deuided, which parts, we call particular
churches.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Whereas this diuiſion, was by little and little framed,
according to the example of the Prouinces and Dioceſſes, or ſeuerall
juriſdictions of the Romaine Empire, as both the thing it ſelfe, and
alſo, the very names doe ſhew: it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med indeed, to haue beene done vpon
ſome colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but it had a moſt ill iſſue: and wee affirme,
that this is it, that IOHN in the Reuelation, doth meane by the image of the
Beaſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4 For hence it came to paſſe the aequality of the
Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches beeing taken away, and the order of Priorſhip beeing vnder the
colour of auoiding ſchiſme transformed into ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie, that in
ſteede of the Apoſtolicall and the truly diuine gouernment of the church by
the Elderſhip, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine order of Biſhoppes was by little and little
brought in, and from thence preſentlie ſprang, that horrible
Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian tyrannie: the chief head whereof, nowe for theſe manie
yeares, hath beene that counterfait Romaine Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Yet of this order (as long as the Lord raiſed vp thoſe
who did ſo vſe this office of Biſhop inve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by man, as they did
maintaine and ſet forward Gods Church) there was ſome vſe, as whereby in
ſome ſort the puritye of Chriſtian doctrine hath bene maintained.</p>
               <p n="6">6 It was apointed, to the ouerthrow of the endeuours of
Sathan and his miniſters, not by man, but by God; both before the comming of
Chriſt, and in the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that there ſhould bee held
certaine Aſſemblies of the godlie, both for the preſeruation and
reformation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and alſo, for the appeaſing of controuerſies,
riſen in the Church; the which meetings, are called in the ſtorie of the
Chriſtian Church, by the name of Synods and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.</p>
               <p n="7">7 But when as theſe euils, did not alwaies infect the
whole bodie of the Churche, but did rather ſpring from particuler members: It
was not without great cauſe, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <pb n="155" facs="tcp:1885:84"/> in the ancient
Church, that certain Prouinciall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies ſhould be helde at appointed
times: wherin the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, if any had riſen in the prouince, wer
determined according to the worde of God, and the outward order of the Church
ſo appointed as was thought expedient.</p>
               <p n="8">8 As often as the harme grew farther; there is no dout, but
the godly &amp; the religious Paſtors of churches, though dwelling in diuers
Prouinces, did yet conferre togeather without any ambition concerning the
remedies thereof, as it apeareth out of the ſtories of the Councels, and the
wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the ancient Fathers, that were before the councell of Nice: the
aeternal God, verie mightily blesſing their zeal, before euer the ambition of
Biſhoppes ſeas was knowen in the Church.</p>
               <p n="9">9 But as Chriſtian Religion, after that the Romaine Empire
ſubmitted it ſelf vnto Chriſt vnder CONSTANTINE the great, began greatly
to floriſhe, (all outward perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being ended:) So Sathan on the other
ſide, began after a marueilous ſort, openly to ſet vp the Myſtery of
iniquity, which before hand ſecretly had taken ſome growth.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Hervpon, that authority of the Seas ouer their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and fellowe-Miniſters, was eſtabliſhed in that firſt councell of Nice,
which otherwiſe was a Chriſtian aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, and one of the moſt
famous ſince that time; the which authoritie, could bee afterward
reſtrained, by the force of no Canons and decrees, but that it brake vnto
that horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tyrannie, which waſted, and at this day dooth deuour the whole
Church.</p>
               <p n="11">11 There were notwithſtanding (the Lorde rightlie
v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this euill, vnto the preſeruation of his Church) in theſe times
Councels gathered, and ended vnto many good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, by the authority of
godlie Romaine Emperours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe haereſies, which inuaded the
vniuerſall body of the Church, and they are therfore called general councels,
becauſe the Emperours of Rome, did then gouerne the moſt part of the
world.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Now it is manifeſt that theſe councels were
graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Emperours, vpon the entreatie and requeſte of 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1885:85"/> godlie Biſhops, whereas otherwiſe the haeretickes and
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious heades would not haue yealded vnto the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
cenſures and judgements of the godly Paſtors and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, had it not beene
for the authoritie of the Emperours eſpeciallie, ſeeing manie Churches
woulde receaue thoſe that were caſt out by their Paſtors, as the whole
auncient ſtorie doth teſtifie.</p>
               <p n="13">13 It is alſo manifeſt that the Biſhops themſelues,
(or ſuch as was ſent by them to ſupplie their roomes,) ſatte as the
Iudges in theſe councels and meetings: for the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall degree of
ſuperioritie, which was euen then a great ſtaine vnto the Church of God,
was euen at that time crept thereinto.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Yet in theſe meetings, either the Romaine Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
himſelf, or ſome noble men ſent with commiſsion by him in his ſtead,
were preſent: but not as beeing to judge, or to giue the definitiue
ſentence: but as beeing to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the behauiours of the Biſhops
themſelues which yet ſometimes they could by no meanes bring to paſſe
(as yet appeareth in that ſacrilegious ſynod of EPHESVS) &amp; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles
though with great labour, they did in ſome ſort ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p n="15">15 In theſe Synods were heard and admitted, euen lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(as they call them,) that no man ſhould be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before his cauſe were
heard. Now the whole contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie concerning Chriſtian Religion, was
firſt of al &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly defined out of the written word of God: Next, and
in the ſecond place were brought, the auncient Chriſtian Fathers; yet ſo,
as of them ſelues they were not beleeued, but receiued ſo far as they
agreed to the word of God. To conclude, the determination of the Synods, being
ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chriſtian Emperours, were eſtabliſhed by their
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable conſtitutions.</p>
               <p n="16">16 In theſe Synodes were determined, both the waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
controuerſies riſen among the Biſhoppes themſelues, togeather with
their elections and depoſitions; and alſo, the rules concerning the
generall gouernement of the Church, which the Greekes call Canons, were
enacted.</p>
               <p n="17">
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:1885:85"/>17 Hence it appeareth, what place
thoſe Councels are to haue, which are called by the authoritie of the
counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Romaine Biſhop, and concluded by the ſuffrages and voyce of
his own vaſſals, both to the eſtabliſhing of his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranie, and alſo,
to the ouerthrow of all godlines, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer good order hath bene
confirmed by the approoued ancient Canons.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Now that the Romain Empire is ſeuered into parts, and
the gouernment of Chriſtendome deuided into diuers kingdomes and eſtates:
If any man ſhould demand, what way we think meet, for the gathering of
Synods, we anſwer after this ſort.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Firſt, in thoſe Churches, who haue Chriſtian
Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats, care is to be had, after the truth of Religion, and the right
gouernement of the Church be eſtabliſhed, that they haue ſetled ordinary
meetinges, according to the conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſtribution, that they haue made of
their Churches, to the ende, that the controuerſies, either alreadie riſen,
or beeing likelie to ariſe, maye bee appeaſed and preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the
progreſſe of the Churches of euery Prouince may be looked vnto; vnto which
worke, the authoritye of the Chriſtian Magiſtrates is alſo to be
vſed.</p>
               <p n="20">20 But where the Magiſtrates doe not profeſſe true
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we ſee not to what end, the appointing of Synodes, either
ordinarie or extraordinarie, ſhould depend vppon their authoritie. In ſuch
a caſe then, the Paſtors are wiſely to fore-ſee, that the Church of God
be gouerned, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the impediments of the aduerſaries.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Now, what hope there can be of a generall Counſel
amongſt ſo many diſtinct kingdoms and eſtates we ſee not; ſeeing
that they, who do purpoſely withſtand the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, will
neuer agree, that there ſhall bee a lawefull and free meeting. And ſeeing
alſo, too many of thoſe, whom the Lord hath in theſe times, inlightned
with the brightnes of his Goſpell, are ſo drawen into diuers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that there is left but ſmall hope of reconciliation, except that Princes,
beeing kindled indeede, with the true zeale of Chriſts glory, would by their
authoritie, reſtraine <pb n="158" facs="tcp:1885:86"/> the madnes of ſome of the
Bellowſes and firebrandes, that Sathan hath raiſed in theſe our daies:
ſo that the diſcourſe concerning ſuch a general Councel may at this
time ſeeme ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p n="22">22 But if the queſtion be in generall, what the
authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the determination of Councels ought to be, wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
brieflie and plainlie; ſeeing we know fully, that thoſe ancient general
Synods, as both thoſe foure moſt famous, gathered againſt the
blaſphemies of ARRIVS, MACEDONI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VS, NESTORIVS, and other ſuche monſters;
and alſo, manie others helde againſt the Monothelites, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophyſites,
were lawefull and altogeather agreeable vnto Gods woorde, in reſpect of the
truth of Doctrine; that hee which diſſenteth from theſe Synods in
reſpect of Doctrine, may juſtlie be ſaid to ſwarue from the very worde
of God, which is the rule of all lawfull Synods.</p>
               <p n="23">23 Wee dare not affirme this, without exception of all
prouincial ſynods, bicauſe they are found marueilous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie and
repugnant one to another. Therefore wee doe affirme, that the determinations of
thoſe Synods, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Doctrine, is to be very carefully and religiouſly
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, according vnto the rule of Gods worde, or the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the
Apoſtles, &amp; the analogie of faith, briefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the
Apoſtolicall beliefe.</p>
               <p n="24">24 Now, as touching thoſe general councels that were
manifeſtlie tyrannicall, as that firſt of EPHESVS, and the ſecond of
NICE, wherein the worſhipping of Images was eſtabliſhed: and all others
gathered againſt Gods truth, by the counterfeit Biſhops of Rome, together
with al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall aſſemblies like vnto them: we do not onely not
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, but holde them accurſed, according to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of PAVLE,
ſeeing the true, much leſſe the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Biſhops, are not in
authoritie aboue the Angels, whom he commaundeth to be held accurſed, if they
teach any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpell.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Now in thoſe thinges, which belong vnto the good order
of the Church, be they eſtabliſhed by ancient or lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Canons: This is

againſt falſe teachers, and apply the ſame vnto their time: So in the

Euangeliſtes, hee indued with a certaine greater meaſure of his Spirit,
thoſe, whome he thought good; by whoſe writings, poſterities might be
inſtructed, not that they ſhould adde or detract any thing from the worde
of GOD, or change any ſyllable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: But that they ſhould bee the true

that the ſtorie of the ancient Church is to be knowen out of their

            <argument>
               <p>WE HAVE IN THE FORMER PRINCIPLES dealt, both with the word beeing
one of the markes of the Church, and alſo with thoſe things that depend
thervpon: now we are to handle the other marke thereof, vz. the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and firſt in generall.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 VVHen as God of his infinit goodnes, would not haue his
Church after the fall of man, <pb n="161" facs="tcp:1885:87"/> to remaine in that
miſerable eſtate: hee did not onelie in word and promiſes declare his
goodnes thereunto, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſauing thereof by Chriſt: but alſo
added cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rites and ceremonies, whereby hee might confirme the ſame in
the aſſurance of his diuine goodnes towardes it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Theſe rites did the Grecians call Myſteries, becauſe
they ſignified ſecrete and hidden matters, which can bee known vnto none,
ſaue vnto thoſe only, that are inſtructed, that is, vnto the members of
Gods Church. Now the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines called them Sacraments, either becauſe the
woorde <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was ſo interpreted, by
the olde tranſlatour of the new Teſtament, or becauſe theſe rites, are
the markes of the couenaunt betweene God and vs, that hee ſhould bee our God,
and we his people, and that by a Metaphore bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the Sacraments, that
is, the ſolemne oathes, whereby ſouldiers bound themſelues vnto their
Captains, and the Captaines againe vnto them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now, although neither the word MYSTERIE, nor SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRAMEMT, be
found in the Scripture, in that ſence whereof wee nowe ſpeake: yet thoſe
godlie fathers haue added no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnto the worde, when as they vſed theſe
tearmes for the expreſsing of the ſaid rites.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Now becauſe the word Sacrament is by the Latine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
referred vnto al kind of ſignes, which are vſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe holie
thinges; it is to bee obſerued, that in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the ſame is
particularlie referred vnto the ſignes of the grace of God in Chriſt, and
that, two manner of waies: for a Sacrament dooth ſometimes comprehend the
externall ſignes onelie, and ſometimes the things ſignified together with
the ſignes, and a certain holie action alſo.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Sacraments taken in the former ſignification, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
to be certaine viſible ſignes inſtituted by God vnto the vſe of the
Church, where by God doth ſeale in the harts of the faithfull, the promiſe
of the grace of free ſaluation by Chriſt, and ſo dooth more and more
confirme their fayth, and witnes the fellowſhip which the Saints haue
amongſt themſelues, vnder Chriſt their head.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:1885:88"/>6 In the latter ſenſe we define them
to be a certain ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie action, enjoined by God vnto the Church: wherein, as GOD
in a kinde of agreeable proportion, betweene the ſignes and the things
ſignified, offereth vnto the ſenſes of our bodie, by the hand of the
Miniſter, the things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto our ſaluation in Chriſt: ſo
dooth hee giue vnto our ſoules the heauenlie thinges themſelues, to the end
that they ſhould ſpirituallie by faith, be more &amp; more ſealed in
them.</p>
            <p n="7">7 By ſignes in this place, we vnderſtand not natural or
miraculous, but voluntarie ſignes: becauſe they are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the will
of God, to be ſignes of his grace in Chriſt, which by nature they are not:
neither are they ſignes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, but partlie remembraunces of things paſt,
and partly ſeales of things preſent, and alſo to come.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But nowe, wee will conſider in order of the cauſes of
the Sacramentes. The efficient is GOD onelie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that as it
appertaineth to him alone to promiſe grace; ſo dooth it alſo to add the
ſeales thereof thereunto. Therefore alſo, there are neither anie other
Sacramentes to be receiued into the Church, neither is the manner of the
inſtitution to be anie wiſe violated.</p>
            <p>Whoſoeuer therefore doe breake out into that boldneſſe, that
either they dare coyne new Sacraments, or add anie vnto thoſe that were
appointed by the lord, or detract anie title from them, they are guiltie of
trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the Majeſtie of the higheſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The matter of the Sacraments are of two ſorts, the one
externall and corporall, which are perceaued by the ſenſes of the bodie:
the other inward and ſpirituall, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the minde and the ſoule.</p>
            <p n="10">10 The forme of the Sacraments, is the ordinaunce of God,
comprehended in his Word: for the Sacraments are that altogeather (and nothing
elſe) which GOD by the word of his Diuine inſtitution, dooth teſtifie
that hee will haue them to bee: ſo that the word is as it were the ſoule of
the Sacraments, in regarde that it teſtifieth what the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ordinaunce

            <p n="11">11 The chiefe end of them in reſpect of vs, is the
ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the faithfull, by ſealing their conjunction with Chriſt.
For God, not contented with the generall preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his promiſes, thinketh
it meet to ſeale, and to offer them in ſpeciall vnto euerie particular
beleeuer, hauing a regarde thereby to their infirmitie.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Other ends alſo they haue, which are of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as that by them we ſhould be put in remembrance of the benefites of Chriſt,
that the Church ſhould bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from other ſects. For, as God
will be diſcerned from Idols: ſo hee will haue his people ſeuered by
theſe markes, from the Kingdome of the Deuill: that they ſhuld bee bandes
of the mutuall loue of the faithfull. Brieflie, that they ſhould bee a
profeſsion and a teſtification of the onelie true Religion, and of our
duety towardes our God.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Nowe the inſtrument to vſe the Sacraments aright, is
Faith: whence it appeareth that the faithfull onelie doe receaue them, as it is
meet, whereas all others doe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate the outwarde ſignes onelie, and
that to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p>They erre therefore, who hold that vnbeleuers do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the thing
ſignified, that is Chriſt, together with the ſignes.</p>
            <p>And they alſo doe ouer-wickedlie abuſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, who
adminiſter them to thinges without life.</p>
            <p n="14">14 The change of the ſignes in the Sacramentes, is not
naturall, but reſpectiue by vertue of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of GOD: for the
ſignes are chaunged, not in reſpect of their nature, but onelie in regarde
of their vſe: namelie, whereas the things which before were common, are by
Gods commandement become the ſignes of heuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thinges: and this is the
conſecration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:1885:89"/>They erre therefore, and deſtroy the whole
nature of the Sacramentes, who teach, that the ſubſtance of the ſignes,
are, (as it were) by a kinde of magicall enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either chaunged, or
aboliſhed.</p>
            <p n="15">15 The conjunction of the ſignes and the thinges
ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, is alſo reſpectiue, in regarde of the ordinaunce of God,
whereby inuiſible and incorporall things, are in a kinde of fit proportion,
repreſented by corporall and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible elements: in ſuch ſort, as God
doth giue both, by the hand of the Miniſter, and both are receaued in their
lawful vſe.</p>
            <p>They erre therefore who holde that there is a reall joining
together, and preſence of the ſignes &amp; the thing ſignified.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Vnto this ſacramental change, and the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
the things with the ſignes, there is no place left, but onelie in the
adminiſtration of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>They are therefore to be condemned, who doo attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſome
holines vnto the ſignes: and as for thoſe who worſhip them, them wee
vtterlie deteſt as open Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p n="17">17 The Sacramentall ſpeaches and phraſes, are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proper or figuratiue: proper, as when that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth vnto the
ſigne, is attributed vnto the ſame: &amp; that which is peculiar vnto the
thing ſignified, is diſtinctly applied therevnto: and theſe do forbid vs
to attribute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſignes anie more then is meete, namelie, that wee
ſhould not take them for the things ſignified.</p>
            <p>They are no leſſe impious therefore, then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who
worſhip the ſignes, in the verie Sacramentall vſe.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Theſe are figuratiue ſpeaches, wherein we ſee the
names and effects of the things ſignified, attributed vnto the ſignes, and
contrariwiſe, the names or the effectes of the ſignes, applied vnto the
things ſignified: which is done to expreſſe that moſte true, and
moſte neere ſacramental conjunction of the ſignes with the thinges, and
that wee ſhould not attribute leſſe vnto them then were meet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:1885:89"/>They therefore doe attribute leſſe then is
meete vnto the Sacraments, who will haue them onelie to be ſignes of
remembraunce, thereby excluding the true giuing &amp; receauing of the things
ſignified.</p>
            <p>Yet are they in a leſſe errour, who will haue them to be
ſignes onelie of our outward profeſsion.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Nowe, in aſmuch as the Sacraments are ſupplies joined
vnto the worde, it commeth to paſſe, that in ſome thinges they agree
together, and differ in ſome other. For both are inſtruments which the
holie Ghoſt vſeth to make vs partakers of Chriſt and his benefites: yet
ſo, as hee may worke without them both in the harts of the godlie, when, and
as often as he will: and that he doth not anie wiſe giue vnto the ſignes,
his owne force and efficacie, by vertue whereof the thinges ſignified are
receaued.</p>
            <p>They are blaſphemous therefore, who will haue grace either in
whole, or in part, to bee beſtowed by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. And they are no
leſſe blaſphemous, who will haue this to be done, by the worke
wrought.</p>
            <p n="20">20 The force of the Sacramentes doth in no wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon the perſon of the Miniſter, who deliuereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but vpon the
ordinaunce of God onlie, ſo that the ſame be obſerued: and that by a
publick perſon, either rightly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; or at the leaſt exerciſing a
publick function by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon errour.</p>
            <p>The Donatiſts therefore, and ſuch like did erre, who taught that
the Sacramentes adminiſtred by euill Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, were of no force.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Euen as the Goſpell, who of it owne nature is the word
of life and ſaluation, is yet turned by the wicked vnto the ſauor of death:
ſo the Sacramentes alſo, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God vnto the
ſaluation of men, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, receaued by the faithleſſe
&amp; the vnworthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, vnto their condemnation and judgement: and
yet do they not deſiſt in reſpect of God, to bee true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſtill.</p>
            <p n="22">22 As the ſeede of the woord preached, dooth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
bring forth fruit at the ſame moment that it is ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="166" facs="tcp:1885:90"/> in the heartes of the faithfull: ſo the fruit of the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of
the Sacraments dooth not preſentlie ſhewe it ſelfe, in ſuch ſort as
the faithfull haue receaued the ſame: For that is onelie done at the time
appointed by God.</p>
            <p n="23">23 As the holie Ghoſt by meanes of the word, dooth beget
and ſtrengthen faith; ſo dooth he ſturre vp and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame by
the Sacraments. And therefore regarde is to be had, that they who are of the
age of diſcretion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the effectuall preaching of the word, wherby faith
may be wrought in them, before they receaue the Sacraments, that ſo they may
worthelie participat them, which cannot be without faith.</p>
            <p n="24">24 The word is neceſſarie (ſaue when it pleaſeth God
to work extraordinarilie in the harts of his children) and ſufficient vnto
their ſaluation that are of age: but the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are not abſolutelie
and preciſelie neceſſarie vnto all. For it is not the want of them, but
their contempt that is damnable.</p>
            <p n="25">25 The word of promiſe is without reſpect to bee
offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, both vnto the beleeuing, and to the vnfaithfull, and that generallie.
But the Sacraments are onelie to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred vnto thoſe that are taken
for the knowne members of the Church; and that, vnto euerie one of them
ſeueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, whereby a particular full aſſurance may be wrought in

            <p n="26">26 The preaching of the word may be offered alone vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the

SACRAMENTS OF THE OLDE AND NEVV TESTAMENT. LVI.</head>
            <p n="1">1 INaſmuch as men can be joined together, (as AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE
ſaith) in no Religion, be it true, or be it falſe, except they be tied by
ſome kinde of viſible thinges and ſacramentes: hence it commeth, that the
Church ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnder the olde or vnder the new Teſtament, hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wanted
the ſeales of the grace of God, that is, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Of theſe thinges ſeeing we haue ſpoken generallie in
the former diſputation; we may now conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſee what agreement and what
difference there was, between the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of both the couenaunts: that by
this meanes it may bee declared, that the ſame faith was vnder both of
them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Vnto this treatiſe we lay this moſt true ground, as a
foundation: namelie, that the couenaunt of God with his Church was alwaies one
and the ſame, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſeemed to bee diuers, in regard of
the diuers cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the diſpenſation, whence did ariſe the
name and the difference of the old and the new Teſtament or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt.
Whereas therefore the thinges remained in the ſame in regard of
ſubſtance, the ſignes were chaunged, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the circumſtance
of time. For the fathers (as the Apoſtle ſaith 1. COR. 10.) did eate of the
ſame ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meat, and drinke the ſame ſpirituall drinke, out of
the rock that followed them, the which rock was Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But to the end that the whole matter may bee the more
manifeſt, we will more particularlie ſet downe their agreement and
difference: and firſt of all their agreement, which conſiſteth in their
efficient and finall cauſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Their efficient cauſe, is one and the ſame, namelie God,
the authour of the Sacramentes of both the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunts, who alone (as hath
beene already ſet downe) hath <pb n="168" facs="tcp:1885:91"/> authoritie to appoint
Sacraments, as hee onelie is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe grace.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The finall alſo, is one and the ſame. For they reſpect
the ſame end and ſcope, and teach the verie ſame things, to wit, Ieſus
Chriſt, &amp; the participation of all his benefites vnto aeternall life.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The difference conſiſteth in the manner and meaſure of
ſignifiyng or applying Chriſt, and alſo in the outwarde matter, forme and
number.</p>
            <p n="8">8 For the Sacraments of the olde Teſtament, did ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Chriſt to come, and therefore at his comming they cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ours came in
their place.</p>
            <p>Wherefore they were juſtlie condemned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who
taught that Circumciſion was to bee joined vnto Baptiſme, as beeing as yet
neceſſarie vnto ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And a fewe yeares after the Ebionites, who
woulde retaine the Iewiſh ceremonies, together with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Sacraments.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Nowe, the Sacraments of the newe Teſtament, doe ſhewe
that Chriſt is already come, and they are therefore eſtabliſhed with new
ſignes, that are to continue vnto the worlds end, whereas the other were
onelie appointed for ſome certaine time.</p>
            <p n="10">10 The nerer furthermore, that Chriſt hath manifeſted
himſelf vnto vs, by ſo much the more clearlie, doe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes of the
newe Teſtament lay him before vs. For, things that are paſt are better
knowne, then theſe that are to come. And therefore AVGVSTINE hath ſaide
well, that wee haue fewer Sacramentes then the Iewes had, but yet clearer, and
a great deale more ſignificatiue, and therfore of greater efficacie to
confirme our faith, and to ſeale the promiſes of God in our hearts.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The which ſaying of AVGVSTINE, is to bee rightlie
vnderſtood. For wee thinke not (as the Schoole-men did) that they vnder the
law, had the ſame grace onely ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto them in the Sacraments, which
is offered as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto vs into ours: ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith,
that they did eate the ſame ſpirituall meat.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:1885:91"/>12 It appeareth that their outward
matter and forme, was diuers from the Sacraments of the new Teſtament, by the
verie ſignes, rites, and manner of adminiſtration.</p>
            <p n="13">13 That they differed in nomber it is out of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie:
for we, (according vnto the inſtitution of Chriſt) doe acknowledge onelie
two, Baptiſme, and the holie Supper: they had more, as Circumciſion, the
Paſchall lamb, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and oblations.</p>
            <p>Wee doe therefore condemne the Manichaees, who taught, that the
things ſignified vnder the olde law were changed together with the

               <p>WE HAVE DEALT TOVCHING SACRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in generall, and the difference

            <p n="1">1 THe Sacraments of the new Teſtament, are thoſe which
Chriſt hath inſtituted in his Church, to continue vntill his ſecond

            <p n="2">2 Of this ſort there are onelie two, Baptiſme, and the

nouriſhed and ſuſtained in the Church.</p>
            <p>Confirmation, Repentance, extreame vnction, order and mariage,
(which the Papiſts account among the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments) are none in deed.</p>
            <p n="3">3 For the true definition of a Sacrament cannot agree vnto
them.</p>
            <p>Now that definition which they bring, that a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a
viſible ſigne of an inuiſible thing, reacheth a <pb n="170" facs="tcp:1885:92"/>
great deale toe farre, and is not proper vnto this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Therfore, although the Fathers in the verie puritie of the
auncient Church, did vſe the worde Sacrament in a verie large
ſignification: yet did they not acknowledge any more Sacraments of grace,
then theſe two, ſo far were they from admitting the other fiue into the
nomber of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="5">5 For theſe doe want in deede that forme whereby the
Sacraments are that which they are: that is, the worde of God, or the
inſtitution of Chriſt, (whoſe office alone it is to ordaine Sacramentes)
comprehended in his word.</p>
            <p n="6">6 And none of them doe teſtifie the vnion that the Saints
haue betweene themſelues, vnder Ieſus Chriſt their head.</p>
            <p n="7">7 We do not denie but there were ſome vſe of them in the
auncient and purer Church, but we affirme it to bee a far other, than that
which is now in Poperie.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The Papiſts make Confirmation to be the next Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vnto Baptiſme: and they ſay, that it is that, wherby the children of
Chriſtians, that are come to age, after they are annointed in the fore-head
with oile, and haue recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a blow or a pat of the Biſhop, doe (forſooth)
receaue the holie Ghoſt, though they make no confeſsion at all of their
Faith.</p>
            <p n="9">9 But the Fathers made that to be Confirmation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
thoſe that were baptiſed when they were infants, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after inſtructed
in the Chriſtian Religion, were, by lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng on of hands, and ſolemne
prayers, after they had made publick confeſsion of their faith, commended
vnto God and the church.</p>
            <p n="10">10 But it was not a Sacrament, for it wanted a proper
viſible ſigne, which is one neceſſarie part of the matter of a
Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="11">11 True Repentaunce wee admitte in the Church, as beeing
altogether neceſſarie vnto the ſaluation of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers that are come
to age, although it hath not alwaies ſatisfaction before the Church joyned
with it.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:1885:92"/>12 Now the Papiſts call that
Repentaunce, when as a man being touched with a perfect contrition for his
ſinns, doth confeſſe them by making a full reckoning of them in the eares
of the ſacrificing maſſe-prieſt, by whome, after he hath receaued
abſolution, he is enjoined to make ſuche a ſatisfaction, as receauing
force from the merits of Chriſt doth ſatisfie Gods juſtice.</p>
            <p n="13">13 And ſeeing furthermore, it hath no viſible ſigne, it
can not be a Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="14">14 They make extreame vnction to be a fift Sacrament whereby
ſome perſon beeing at the point of death, is by the ſacrificing
Maſſe-prieſt annointed with oile, that the paines of Purgatory may be
remitted vnto him.</p>
            <p n="15">15 In the time of the Apoſtles, when as the guiftes of
miracles remained, as yet, thoſe who were ſick, were wont to call the
Elders of the Church, by whome they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, and ſo did oftentimes
recouer their health.</p>
            <p n="16">16 But miracles beeing ceaſed, vnction alſo hath
cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and therefore is no Sacrament: for the Sacraments of the new

            <p n="17">17 Orders amongſt the Papiſts, are rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,

            <p n="18">18 It is out of controuerſie, that in the Church of God

            <p n="6">6 The formall cauſe of Baptiſme conſiſteth in the
law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe of the inſtitution: the eſpeciall part whereof, is the
inuocation of the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holie Ghoſt,
together with the rite either of dipping into the water, or of the
ſprinckling of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="7">7 For it is not greatlie materiall, whether the perſon that
is to be baptiſed, be whollie dipt vnder the water, or whether the water bee

neither thinke we, that any contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be made, whether the water is
to bee once or thriſe applied.</p>
            <p n="9">9 It is not lawfull, no not for any Angell in heauen, to
ordaine any Sacramentall rites, ſeeing the ſignification of them doeth
reſpect the promiſe of grace. For it is in the power of GOD alone, both to

            <p n="11">11 The firſt that the Lorde appointed to publiſhe this

declare the originall vſe, and end of Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Therefore alſo, Baptiſme is profaned by them, who either
adminiſter the ſame without any expoſition, or depraue the

               <p>WEE HAVE DISPVTED IN THE FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Principles touching the cauſes
and effects of Baptiſm: it followeth, that wee deale with thoſe things,
touching the ſame argument, which wee referred vnto this Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 THe ſubject of Baptiſme is hee, who is baptized: And all
thoſe are to bee baptized, who in regard of likelihood, are contained within
the couenant of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Now, the infants that are the progenie of beleeuing Parents;
and alſo thoſe, who beeing of full age, doe offer themſelues vnto the
church, by making profeſsion of their faith, and yeelding their conſent
vnto the Doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in prefeſſed, are to be accounted within the
couenant.</p>
            <p n="3">3 We holde, that they who are of full age, are not to be
receiued vnto baptiſme, before ſuch time as they be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and haue
yeelded a confesſion of their true faith, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1885:99"/>
with a proteſtation, that they will lead a better life: Becauſe for more
aſſurance, the confesſion of the mouth is to be required at their
hands.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Touching infants, ſeeing our adoption doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon our ſelues, or vpon any outward thing, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the election of
God, which began to be manifeſted at our very conception, by vertue of that
couenant, [I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed,] and againe, [I will
be the God of thoſe that feare me vnto a thouſand genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:] And
although, that infants be not indued with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall faith, which is, by hearing:
yet doe wee at this day, juſtlie baptize, (as in times paſt they were
circumciſed) the infants of the Saints, becauſe they are comprehended with
in the couenaunt of aeternall life, by meanes of the faith of their
Parents.</p>
            <p n="5">5 It maketh nothing againſt this point, that al, who are
borne of faithfull Parents, are not elected: For if this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might
preuaile, wee would hardly be drawen to admit thoſe, that are of yeares:
Seeing all that profeſſe, are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. It is not our part, to enquire
into thoſe ſecrete my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God: but wee may juſtlie
preſuppoſe, that both all their children who profeſſe Chriſtianitie,
and all thoſe alſo, who being of full yeares, doe make profesſion of true
faith, are elected vnto aeternall life.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Whereas euery man is ſaid to bee ſaued by his owne
faith, and not by another mans; it is to be vnderſtood one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe that
are of yeares: and we cannot allow of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, concerning the actuall
faith of infants. But leauing vnto God his ſecrete judgements, wee doubt not,
but that the faithfull Parents, doe according vnto the condition of the
couenant, apprehend the promiſe both to themſelues, and alſo to their
children.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now the Sacramental adding of the ſeale, doth
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe that, which is ſealed to be preſent indeed; namely, that
the partie baptized, is by likelihoode comprehended within the couenant.</p>
            <p n="8">8 If no wel ordered Church did euer admit, either Iews or
Turkes being of yeares, or any other the profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies 
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1885:99"/> of Chriſt, vntill they had beene catechiſed, and made
open profesſion of Chriſtianitie: much leſſe, cann any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their
children, but with the manifeſt profanation of Baptiſme.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Touching Papiſtes, wee are in ſome ſort to thinke
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of them; in aſmuch as wee may juſtly preſuppoſe, that the
Church doeth as yet remaine within the filthines of Poperie, (in reſpect of
the elect, that are in their time to be drawen out of that mire) becauſe that
the ſeale of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie, though defiled with many ſpots and
ſtaines, hath continued among them, in the ſubſtantiall forme thereof: as
alſo the doctrine of Chriſtianitie, in reſpect of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the
perſon of Chriſt: And therefore we are of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the children of
Papiſtes, may bee receiued vnto Baptiſme, if either one of the Parents do
require the ſame, or ſom man be preſent, that wil promiſe their right
bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp.</p>
            <p n="10">10 It is a great error, to tie ſaluation vnto the outward
Sacramentes, as though they were abſolutelie neceſſarie therevnto; which
the Papiſtes themſelues, that are of anie ſound judgement doe not
altogeather holde. And on the other ſide, hee that deſpiſeth the marke of
the couenant, is juſtlie guiltie of aeternall death: And therefore it is not
the want, but the contempt of Baptiſme that is damnable; the which ſinne,
(as alſo all other) may bee done away by true repentance.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Now he cannot be accounted a contemner of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, who
wanted oportunitie to receiue the ſame lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
            <p>And therefore, wee doe caſt away theſe caſes of
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, and all the corruptions brought into the Church vpon this
occaſion, as being the inuentions of men.</p>
            <p n="12">12 The effects of Baptiſme adminiſtred, either vnto
infants, or vnto thoſe that are of age, is not to be tied vnto the verie time
of the adminiſtration thereof. For the ſeede, both of the worde, and alſo
of the Sacraments, lieth as it were, buried in the earth, as long as it
pleaſeth God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his grace.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:1885:100"/>13 Now, ſeeing wee are baptized for
our whole life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that Chriſt doeth neuer caſt away thoſe that
were giuen him; it followeth, that Baptiſme is not to be ittera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>We doe therefore condemne Rebaptization; neither can wee in this
point, allow of CYPRIAN, and the Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane Churches; and eſpeciallie of that
falſe and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous opinion, which holdeth, that the remisſion of ſins
paſt, is onely ſealed by Baptiſme: whence it came to paſſe, that
ſome did very careleſly defer Baptiſme vnto their laſt end.</p>
            <p n="14">14 The Baptiſme of IOHN and of Chriſt, was one and the

            <p n="15">15 The moſt meete place for Baptiſme to bee

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:1885:100"/>2 For it was meet, the Mediatour being
now come, &amp; the couenaunt beeing nowe laſt renewed by him, that the olde
ſeales of the couenaunt ſhould be changed into ſuch, as might agree to
the time both of the ordaining of them, and alſo of their laſt renuing, and
ſo might euen declare that the Mediatour was come both by water and by
blood.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Nowe the Supper is that laſt Sacrament of the newe
Teſtament, or that publick action of the Chriſtian church, wherein, as the
bread being broken, is giuen to be eaten, and the wine powred out, giuen to be
drunk after the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall manner: ſo the bodie of Chriſt beeing deliuered
to death, and his blood being ſhed to ſeale vp thoſe that are in league
with God, is giuen vnto the faithful that can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themſelues, and are
ſpirituallie receaued of them by faith, for thoſe endes; which wee will
preſentlie ſet down.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The authour both of the thinges deliuered, and of the action
is Chriſt onelie, who (as far as this Teſtament is called the new) is the
onlie teſtator: but in reſpect that it hath regard vnto the couenaunt, that
joineth others ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the authour thereof is he, who is the authour of the
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt. The Church is the partie vnto whome the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made: and
therefore the Church is not to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it, the authoritie to confirme this
couenaunt.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The matter of the Supper, are the ſignes, and the things
ſignified. Vnder the name of ſignes, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended not onlie the
ſubſtantiall things themſelues, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the bread and the wine: but
alſo the rites, and the whole action as farre as it is Sacramentall; namelie,
the breaking of the bread, the powring out of the wine, the delyuering and
receauing of both: whereunto is joined the nouriſhment of the bodie,
ariſing of the receauing of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Touching the bread, whether it ſhould bee leauened or
vnleauened; touching the wine, whether it ſhoulde bee pure, or mixed with
water: and if wine bee wanting, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lawfull to vſe ſome other
drinke: we thinke them <pb n="182" facs="tcp:1885:101"/> matters, about which, no great
contentions are to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; ſo that (if neceſsitie ſo require) that
which is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall thing, be retained, namelie, meat and drinke, meete
for nouriſhment, and anſwerable vnto the proportion of the ſignes and the
things ſignified.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The adminiſtration of the ſignes, becauſe they are
preſent vnto our outward ſenſes, hath Chriſt committed vnto the
Miniſters of the worde, but yet ſo; as the efficacie of the
adminiſtration doth not depend vpon them, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Chriſt onelie.</p>
            <p n="8">8 For this cauſe alſo, the things which we name ſignes
are receaued by the mouth of the bodie: and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the wicked,
(although they account them not for ſignes, but for common things) and that
the receauing of them is turned vnto their greater damnation.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The thinges ſealed, are the bodie and the bloode of
Chriſt, the offering and receauing of both, and the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
nouriſhment ariſing therefrom: or rather whole Chriſt God and man, with
all his benefites, and the newe coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant confirmed by the death of the
teſtator.</p>
            <p n="10">10 For although the receauing of the bread and the wine, doth
onelie ſignifie the communion of the body and the blood: yet becauſe wee
are made one with Chriſt, by meanes of his humaine nature, it doth ſeale
vnto vs the whole benefite of ſaluation: becauſe neither the manhood can be
ſeperated from the word, nor the humanitie ſubſiſt without the Deitie,
or his benefits without the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and therefore, the one are neither
receaued nor deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered without the other.</p>
            <p n="11">11 It is not without cauſe, that Chriſt hath ſeuerallie
ordained the bread to be the Sacrament of his bodie, and the wine of his blood:
and commanded them to bee ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie deliuered in the Church. For the bodie
and blood are not ſacramentally repreſented vnto vs in this action, as the
whole humanitie of Chriſt, being glorified doth now liue: but in regard that
they were offered vppon the croſſe for vs, the blood being powred out of
the bodie.</p>
            <p>Vaine therfore is that concomitaunce, (as they call it) 
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1885:101"/> or inſeparable conjunction of the body and the blood,
vnder both kindes ſeuerallie, whereas the bodie is here laid before vs and
giuen to bee conſidered by our faith, as being without blood, and the blood
as powred out of the bodie by death.</p>
            <p n="12">12 The things ſignified, becauſe they are giuen vnto our
minde, and that to eſtabliſh and increaſe a ſpirituall life in vs, are
giuen by Chriſt himſelfe, and receaued through faith, by the power of the
holie Ghoſt: whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that they are proper and peculiar vnto the
faithfull onelie.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Yet doth it not follow, that the bread and the wine giuen
vnto the vnbeleeuers, are not Sacramentes. For in reſpect of Chriſt, he
giueth vnto euerie man that whollie, which he promiſeth in his worde: vz. the
ſignes vnto the bodies, and the thinges vnto the ſoules that are endued
with true faith: wherevpon it is no maruell, if the one of them alone be
receaued by the vnworthie communicants as bringing onelie their bodie, and that
polluted too, vnto the Lords Table, whereas they want the mouth of the minde,
that is, faith.</p>
            <p n="14">14 The forme conſiſteth in the apt and meet, that is,
ſacramentall and reſpectiue conjunction and analogie, or agreement of the
outwarde ſigne, and the inwarde myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p>The Tranſubſtantiation of the ſignes and the thinges
ſignified, and the eſſentiall conſubſtantiation of the things
ſignified with the ſignes, are to bee rejected: for the former doth
aboliſhe one part of the Sacrament, to wit, the ſignes, both of them are
directlie contrary, both vnto the Articles of our faith, concerning the truth
of Chriſts bodie, and alſo vnto the vſe of the Sacraments: whence
followeth that moſt horrible and deteſtable bread-worſhip.</p>
            <p n="15">15 The agreement of the ſignes and the things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
is manifeſt: for as breade and wine doe nouriſh vs in this life: euen ſo,
the bodie and blood of Chriſt, purchaſe aeternall life vnto vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:1885:102"/>Both the bread and the wine therefore are to
bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in the Supper, both, to the end that the whole analogie may be
kept, and alſo for the cauſe alledged in the 11 principle.</p>
            <p n="16">16 This analogie doth depend vpon the diuine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
inſtitution or bleſsing: by vertue wherof common things are drawne vnto a
holie vſe.</p>
            <p>The ſignes therefore, haue by the ordinance of God, no
conſideration at all of a Sacrament, ſaue onely in the action of their
lawfull adminiſtration. Neither are wee to imagine of any force that ſhould
bee engraffed in the ſigns themſelues, ſeing they differ from common
things in regard of a Sacramentall ſignification onely, and that in the very
vſe. That carrying about, an adoration of the ſignes, is moſt horrible
Idolatrie.</p>
            <p n="17">17 As the whole force of the Supper, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
formes of ſpeach, doe ariſe from this analogie: ſo they are to be judged
thereby.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſpeaches therfore, [This is my body, the cup is the new
Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in my blood,] are not to be expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded according to the words, but
according to the meaning; that is by a Sacramentall Metonymie or chaunge of the
name, whereby thoſe things are ſaid to be that, wherof onely they are a
ſigne.</p>
            <p n="18">18 The proper and principall endes of the Suppcr, are both
the ſerious remembraunce (joyned with thankes-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing) of the death of
Chriſt, to his glorie and our profite: and alſo the neerer ingraffing of vs
into the body of Chriſt by faith, beeing ſtrengthened and increaſed, and
our nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vniting with God the Father, by meanes of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, who
dwelleth in vs by his Spirite.</p>
            <p n="19">19 The leſſe principall endes, are the mutuall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and loue of the faithfull, being members of the ſame body, the outward
witnesſing of that mutuall conſent, and the preſeruation of publicke
meetings.</p>
            <p n="20">20 The effects of the Supper, doe differ from the ends, but
in reſpect onely: For ſeeing it is ordained by Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe ends;
it cannot be, but that they ſhould enſue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <pb n="185" facs="tcp:1885:102"/> the
lawfull vſe of the Supper: yet ſo, as the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſignification
is attributed vnto them, as their worke: whereas the whole efficacie is ſolie
referred vnto the holie Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="21">21 The profit and efficacie of the Supper, is not to bee tied
vnto the verie moment of the action of receauing, but doth extend it ſelfe
vnto our whole life: yet is not the action once celebrated, to bee for this
cauſe, euer after neglected, ſeeing no man hath ſuch a perfection of
faith in this life, as he ſtandeth not in need of this ſupport.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>WEE HAVE SPOKEN IN THE FORMER Principles concerning the true vſe
of the Supper of the Lorde: now wee are to ſhew in few wordes, how the ſaid
vſe hath bene diuerſlie depraued by Sathan.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 OF all the errors that haue riſen about the holie Supper
of the Lord, that inuention of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, is the moſt ouglie,
which was brought in and confirmed, eſpecially by LANFRANKE, about the yeare
1050.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For when as the words of Chriſt, inſtituting this
Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ar to be vnderſtood acording vnto his mind who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them
(which alwaies ought to be regarded in all acts, and eſpeciallie in
Teſtaments) ſo, that in this Sacrament, the bodie and bloode of Chriſt,
are truelie, but ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallie, and by faith, giuing credite without
queſtion vnto his woordes receaued. The Tranſubſtantiators, contrary to
all reaſon, and vſe of Sacraments, haue ſo obſtinatelie ſtooke to the
woordes, that manie abſurdities haue riſen thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:1885:103"/>3 Firſt of all, ſeeing all
Sacraments do conſiſt of ſignes and things ſignified, they doe take
away the nature of the ſignes. For they teach that after the Conſecration
(as they call it) the ſignes do not remaine, but that the thing it ſelf
onelie is preſented vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Secondlie, the Sacramentall participation beeing thus
aboliſhed, they make a kinde of imaginary receauing of the Lords bodie and
blood: whereby (as they hold) the bodie which is nowe in heauen, is reallie and
corporallie preſent in infinite places, at the ſame time, and is receaued
at once in whole and in part, by manie and by one: which thing, as it is moſt
abſurde: ſo doth it ouerthrow the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Aſcenſion, and
ſitting at the right hand of the Father.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Thridlie, they haue fained ſuch a change, as maketh that
which is, not to be; and that which is not, to be. For they doe ſo ſpoile
the bread and the wine of their eſſence, as they deſiſt to be bread and
wine, and begin to be ſome other thing: and they dreame of accidences that
are inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in no ſubjectes, againſt the firſt article of the beleife,
which teacheth, that the Lord is the Creator and preſeruer of the things
which he made.</p>
            <p n="6">6 And heere they doe verie fooliſhlie bring in the
om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie of God: for wee are now to enquire, not what God can, but what
hee will doe according to his written worde. Moreouer it cannot be either that
God can lie, or that Chriſt can be contrarie to himſelf: both which wil
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie come to paſſe, if anie thing be ſaid to haue beene
ordained by Chriſt, contrary to the articles of our faith.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Hence haue riſen two moſt greeuous errours: the former
touching the worſhipping of the bread and the wine, the which in a verie
fearfull blaſphemous ſorte, are thus commonlie ſaluted by the Papiſts:
ALL HAILE, SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOVR OF THE VVORLD, THE VVORD OF THE FATHER, THE TRVE SACRIFICE,
LIVELIE FLESH, THE VVHOLE DEITIE, TRVE MAN, &amp;c. The other touching the
expiatorie and propitiatorie oblation for the ſinnes of the quick and the
dead, which the Church of Rome doth properly call the <pb n="187" facs="tcp:1885:103"/>
Maſſe, and wherein they place the ſomme of all Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
            <p n="8">8 For the Maſſe is not that mingle mangle patched vp as it
were of the ſhreds of diuerſe places gathered heere &amp; there out of the
Scripture, and other authours, which are the reliques of the auncient Liturgie
or common ſeruice booke of the Chriſtians: but it is that ordinarie
propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and oblation (called by them their vnbloodie Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) which is
offered vnto God the Father, for the ſinnes of the quick and the dead.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Nowe, they offend in this point, firſt, becauſe they
change the Sacrament into a ſacrifice: wheras Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding vs to
receaue, and not to offer, ordained a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and not a Sacrifice.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Next, in that they falſlie teach; that in the
Chriſtian Church there remaineth after the death of Chriſt, anie
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatorie Sacrifice, beſides the verie bodie of Chriſt, which is endued
with a true humaine nature and ſoule.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Thridlie, in that they cloſelie accuſe that one and
moſt perfect ſacrifice of Chriſt, of imperfection, by itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the
ſame euerie hand while. For iteration is a note of imperfection, as the
Apoſtle ſaith Heb. 7.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Chriſt indeed commanded all the faithfull to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the memorie of his paſsion: but hee gaue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement vnto anie, that he
ſhould bee ſacrificed. For there ought to be no mention of the NAME and
office of a PRIEST or of an ALTER at this day in the Church of Chriſt. For
Chriſt is now the onelie, and the chief Prieſt, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf
once, an onelie, and a moſt perfect Sacrifice vnto God, neither was there
anie other that could, can, or ſhalbe able to performe that work.</p>
            <p n="13">13 For the Sacrifices that ought nowe to haue place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Chriſtians, are onelie of thankeſgiuing: that the faithfull may giue
thankes vnto God for all his benefites, and offering their prayers vnto him,
may perpetually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate themſelues, whollie, a liuing and an acceptable
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto his majeſtie. An expiatorie or propitiatory ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
there is or can bee no other, but that which Chriſt <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1885:104"/>
once made moſt perfectlie, vppon the Alter of the croſſe.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Yet we do not denie, but that the auncient writers did
giue the name of Sacrifice vnto the Lords Supper: but, as in this point, ſo
in manie other thinges, in a verie farre ſtreatched ſignification: and that
partlie to the end, that (as they thought) they might ſet foorth the dignitie
of this high myſterie, whereat the Angels doe admire: and partlie, that they
might note out, and retaine the cuſtome vſed amongſt the auncient
Chriſtians. Who were wont in their holie feaſtes of loue, to beſtowe and
offer guiftes and offerings of diuers thinges, and euen of meat and drinke:
which beeing collected togeather into one, were ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of by the
Paſtors of the Churches, as firſt of all, they were by praiers offered vnto
God: next, ſome portion of them was taken, wherby the holy Supper was
adminiſtred: laſtlie, that which was left, was beſtowed for the
mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the poore. Out of which rites, the Maſſe-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers doe as
yet retaine the names of OFFERTORI, COL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECT, and COMMVNION. And hence it is
thought, that the name of the MASSE was deriued, euen from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome that
the faithfull had to ſend thoſe things vnto the publick aſſemblies of
the Church, which they would haue beſtowed vpon holie vſes.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Now, it is no leſſe fabulous, that the Popiſh
Maſſe was celebrated by IAMES, or anie other of the Apoſtles; then it is
moſt true, that the ſame was coyned, neither all at once, nor yet by one
and the ſelfe ſame man, but was ſoldered together, as now it is, by manie
Popes, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie yeares: and after that it had bene eiked out, with many
patches which were added thereunto.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Vnto the former errors, there are adjoyned not a few
others: as that it is celebrated, not by the congregation of the faithfull, but
by one Maſſe-monger alone: that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is after the holie action
RESERVED, as it were a preſeruatiue againſt whatſoeuer inconuenience:
that the names of dead Saints are called vpon, and their imaginary merits,
intermingled in the Maſſe: that the one of the ſigns is in a kind of
impudent and altogeather helliſh boldneſſe, <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1885:104"/> taken
away from the lay people, as they call them: that the whole action is done in a
ſtrange tongue: that the Maſſe-Prieſt alone is priuie vnto many things
that are done ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: that they vſe the attire and geſtures of
ſtage-plaiers, and many other things, brought forth by this plant, which the
heauenly Father hath not planted, and therefore, ſhal one day be altogeather
rooted out.</p>
            <p>Therefore, we deteſt this imaginary and blaſphemous ſacrifice
of the Maſſe, which is contrarie vnto Gods worde, and ouerthroweth the
force of Chriſtes Paſsion, and bringeth in almoſt innumerable errours;
and wee pray with al our hearts and ſoules, that the Lord would graunt vnto
all his Churches, the pure and ſound vſe of his holie Supper.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>WEE HAVE ALREADIE DISPVTED, concerning Tranſubſtantiation:
Conſubſtantiation being the neereſt error vnto it, is now to be
handled.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 COnſubſtantiation conſiſteth in this, that the
bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood of the Lord, is ſaid to bee corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, naturally, and
really preſent; in, vnder, and with the bread and the wine.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It hath this common with Tranſubſtantiation, that in
both of them, the wordes of the inſtitution, are in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous ſort
ſtiflie maintained, without any regard vnto the meaning: Although that in
verie deed, the wordes are chaunged in both, by the fained interpretations
whereby they are expounded: whence manie abſurdities doe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Firſt, in that both of them doe take away the force &amp;
nature of a Sacrament, which conſiſteth in this, that two 
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1885:105"/> thinges ſhould bee in them; namely, earthly,
elementarie, and ſignifiyng; then heauenly, inuiſible, and ſignified:
both which are ſeuerallie conſidered, not as they are ſomething
abſolutely and ſimply exiſting of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but as there is a
mutuall compariſon and referrence between them, whereby the ſignes do
repreſent the things ſignified are repreſented.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Next, Tranſubſtantiation maketh that the thing is not
that, which it is, and that it is that, which it is not: but
Conſubſtantiation maketh that two things indeed, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Thirdly, this doctrine doth include contrarieties: for it
affirmeth, that the ſame body is receiued both naturally and
ſupernaturallie; whereas the truth doth teach, that the ſignes are
naturally, and the things ſignified ſupernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie participated.</p>
            <p n="6">6 For the receiuing of the mouth, and alſo the helpe of the
other ſenſes, are heere required by the inſtitution of Chriſt, to the
ende, that that which is naturall and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, may performe his owne office:
the operation alſo of the mind and faith is eſpeciallie to be preſent;
that what is ſpirituall, may be receiued by ſpirituall inſtruments.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Yet wee confeſſe, that the bodie and blood of Chriſt
is offered bodilie, that is, corporallie in the holie Supper: But after the
ſame manner, that PAVLE ſaith, that all the God-head doth dwell in him
corporally; that is trulie and fullie: the Lord performing without all doubt,
that which hee promiſed.</p>
            <p n="8">8 And although the bodie of Chriſt, be of it ſelfe a
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſubſtaunce, and contained within the dimenſions or limites
thereof; yet is it not materially, but ſpiritually ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of vs. For the
fleſhe would haue profited vs nothing, but the Spirite and life: yet we may
ſay in ſome ſenſe, that the bread and the wine, are the bodie and the
blood: and that the bodie and the blood are fed-vpon, namely, in a
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall manner.</p>
            <p n="9">9 This Doctrine alſo, is directly contrary vnto that end of
the inſtitution, whereby Chriſt commaunded vs, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate 
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1885:105"/> his memorie. For if hee bee preſent, his memorie
cannot be called vnto our remembraunce, except wee will ſpeak very
vnproperlie: ſeeing things paſt and not preſent, are called into
memorie.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Againe, it doth aboliſh the nature of Chriſts bodie:
For if the ſame be thus receued by euery one in particuler, it muſt needs
be, both preſent in infinit places at once, and alſo be infinite of it
ſelfe: The which point, is contrary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Articles of our beliefe,
whereby we beleeue, that hee was true man; that hee was borne, ſuffered,
dead, riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, aſcended vp into heauen.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Furthermore, if the receiuing of Chriſt were corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
the ancient Church vnder the law, had not bene par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his bodie,
becauſe the ſame was not as yet borne: which point is contrarie vnto the
Apoſtle, who ſaith, that the Fathers did receiue the ſame ſpirituall
meate, and the ſame ſpirituall drinke.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Further, if Chriſt were corporally preſent, he
ſhould be eaten without reſpect both of the badde, and the good, which is
imposſible. For to eat the fleſh of Chriſt, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt,
to be joyned with Chriſt, and to be drawen from death vnto life; which can by
no meanes agree vnto the wicked.</p>
            <p n="13">13 For they, as AVGVSTINE ſaith, do onely receiue the bread
of the Lorde, but not the bread which is the Lorde: which bread, is alſo vnto
them, not a ſign of Chriſts bodie, but meerely bread: euen as the Sacrifice
of the wicked, are by the Prophet HOSEAH, not called ſacrifice, but only
fleſh. Yet doth GOD juſtlie puniſh in them, the contempt of his grace
offered.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Againe, ſeeing the queſtion in this point, is onelie
touching the ſoule, and the feeding thereof, to offer a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall thing
therevnto, is to bee ignorant of the nature of things, and to mingle heauenly
and earthly things togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſeing that eating of Chriſts bodie with the
mouth, (if it could be poſsiblie done) could not reach vnto the ſoule, but
onely vnto the bodie. And as the blood of Chriſt, doth not waſh them that
are corporallie dipped thereunto, (the <pb n="192" facs="tcp:1885:106"/> which thing might
haue come to paſſe vnto the very Iews, that tormented him:) But thoſe,
who apprehend the force and efficacie thereof by true faith: for they eat his
bodie, and drinke his blood, who ſpiritually (yet not by imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but
truly as hath bin ſaid) apprehend him as he is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto vs of the
Father.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Laſt of all, Conſubſtantiation cannot be
eſtabliſhed by the woordes of the inſtitution: For Chriſt did not
ſay, Heere is my bodie; that is, in, vnder, or with the bread, but this is;
that is, this bread is my bodie: And it were abſurd to ſay, that Chriſt,
who reached the bread vnto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, was corporally in, vnder, and with
that bread.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Now, the ſimilitude of Iron beeing red hotte, of an
infant lying in his ſwathes, of wine contained in the veſſel, are ſo
groſſe, that they need no confutation: for theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions are
natural, wherby new qualities are aplied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bodies, &amp; ſubſtances are
joined vnto ſubſtances: wheras al things in the Supper ar ſupernatural,
depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding vpon the inſtitution of Chriſt. Yea, and that ſupernatural
conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the Deitie of Chriſt is perſonally vnited vnto his
humanitie, can haue no place in this argument: nor yet that miraculous
conjunction, whereby, GOD taking vpon him certain viſible formes, did
manifeſt himſelf vnto ſome; It followeth then, that this compulation is
Sacramentall; whereby the ſignes and the things ſignified wholie
remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Sacraments are that truly, which they are ſaid to be.</p>
            <p n="17">17 The reſt of the proppes of Tranſubſtantiation,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame ſtrength with the former, wee reject, as making no

            <head>PRINCIPLES TOVCHING THE IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOCATION OF GODS NAME. LXIII.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>WEE HAVE DONE WITH THE WORDE and the Sacraments, being the two
markes of the Church, wherevnto, ſeeing Praier, or the inuocation of Gods
name is inſeparablie ioyned: it is conuenient, that in this place, we deale
therewith.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 THe inuocation of God, is an ardent affection bent towards
God, whereby we do both craue and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, onely for Chriſt his
ſake, ſpirituall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſsings, according vnto his
commaundement and promiſes: and alſo doe giue thanks vnto him for
bleſsings receiued.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſame is neceſſarie vnto all Chriſtians, that are
come to yeares: Firſt, becauſe it is that eſpeciall worſhippe of God,
which the couenaunt of grace doth require of vs: Next, becauſe this is the
meanes, whereby God will haue his elect to obtaine and keepe the grace of the
holy Spirit, and all the reſt of his benefites: Brieflie, it is a teſtimony
of Gods couenant in our hearts. For whoſoeuer doe call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the name of
God, they are indued with the Spirite of the adoption of Children, and receiued
into the couenant of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 True inuocation ariſeth firſt, from the true feeling of
our wants, &amp; the knowledge of the ſufficiency of God, and vpon the
promiſe of being hard, which is apprehended by faith.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Inuocation is due onely vnto GOD the Father, the Sonne, and
the holie Ghoſt: both becauſe, hee alone is the onelie Authour of all good
things; and alſo, becauſe that to bee able to heare-and heale all that call
vpon him in all places, belongeth vnto none, ſaue onely vnto the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
God.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:1885:107"/>5 Now, whereas no man is worthie to
preſent himſelfe in the preſence of God; the heauenlie Father, to the
ende that he might driue away from vs, all ſhamefaſtnes &amp; feare, hath
giuen vs the onely Mediator, in whome alone he doth looke vpon vs, as beeing
reconciled, and heareth our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Now the holy Ghoſt is he, who giueth vs
the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of the heart, and true faith in him vpon whome we call;
and doth inwardlie teach vs, what wee ought to pray: ſo that we doe call vpon
the Father, in the name of the Son by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Neither of the three perſons of the Deity therfore, is to
be omitted in true praier, though they bee not alwaies diſtinctlie named: but
wee may ſometimes call vpon God ſimplie, and ſometimes direct our praiers
vnto the father, ſometimes vnto the Sonne, and ſometimes vnto the holie
Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7 By the interceſsion of Chriſt with the father, is ment,
not any praiers proceeding in ſome maner of geſture from him (now in
heauen) on our behalfe: but the price of that redemption of his, wherevpon,
when the Father looketh, hee heareth his: and alſo this; namely, that when
wee call vppon the Father in his name, hee in ſome ſort doth offer our
praiers according vnto the tender care, whereby he is euen now vnſpeakablie
affected towards his members; yet after his owne manner, which is altogeather
vnſearchable vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Seeing Chriſt doth make interceſsion for vs, and with
vs; in ſuch ſort as we haue ſpoken: we holde, that the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the
faithfull are alwaies acceptable vnto God, thogh he doth neither alwais giue
vnto vs that which we rightly ask, nor at the time wherein we aske.</p>
            <p n="9">9 And ſeing our praiers are to be framed, according vnto the
rule of Gods word; we may ſimply without exception, aske thoſe thinges,
which God hath ſimplie and without exception promiſed vnto vs; as the
increaſe of faith, the ſtrength of the Spirite againſt temptations,
remiſsion of ſinnes, and ſuch like. All other things not ſpecially
expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; as the deliuery from this or that danger, and ſuch like; 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1885:107"/> are to be deſired with exception; namely, as farre as
it bee expedient for Gods glory, &amp; according as (and alſo when) hee
thinketh meet, who onely knoweth what is expedient to be granted vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="10">10 The father hath deliuered vnto vs, by his deare ſon, a
moſt perfect generall forme of praier: yet are we not tied vnto the very
words thereof.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The chiefe end of true Praier, is the glorie of God, or
ſome profite that we hope to receiue thereby.</p>
            <p n="12">12 It is meet, that a certaine place &amp; time be apointed,
(if it may be conueniently done) in euery church for publik praier; yet is it
meere ſuperſtition, to thinke, that praiers made in a certaine place, or
time, are of themſelues more effectuall.</p>
            <p n="13">13 The dedications of Temples, and the rites vſed in this
action, are the reliques, partly of Paganiſme, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of Iudaiſme,
and therefore to be vtterly abolliſhed.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Priuate Praiers alſo, are carefully to be practiſed,
in the vſe whereof, it is the part of euery man to conſider, what is
expedient.</p>
            <p n="15">15 There are foure ſorts of Praiers, reckoned vppe by
PAVLE, 1. TIM. 2.1. ſupplications, praiers, interceſsions, and giuing of
thankes; vnder which foure ſorts, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all other.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Theſe foure ſortes may be thus diſcerned;
Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is, when wee deſire to bee deliuered from the euills, that hang
ouer vs: Praier is, when wee craue a better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of our affaires;
For as by Supplication, we intreat the taking away of inconueniences; ſo by
Praier, we craue the ſupplie of thoſe things that are good for vs:
Interceſsion is, when as one of vs doth intreat, for the neceſsitie of an
other; beeing of charitie mooued therevnto: or when as wee complaine vnto God,
of injuries done vnto vs: Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, by thanks-giuing, we praiſe God for the
benefites that we haue receiued, and ſhew, that wee are beholding vnto him,
for al the benefits, both ſpirituall and corporall, that we haue
obtained.</p>
            <p n="17">17 The fruits which we reape by Praier, are diuers. 1. 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1885:108"/> Our heart is inflamed, with an earneſt deſire to
ſeek, loue, and worſhippe God, when as we are accuſtomed in all our
neceſsities to flie vnto him, as vnto an holie anchor. 2. No deſire cometh
to our minde, whereof wee are aſhamed to make him a witneſſe, when as wee
poure out our whole hart before him. 3. We are framed to receiue his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
with thanks-giuing. 4. Hauing obtained that which we did craue, wee are more
feruentlie carried to meditate of his louing kindnes. 5. Laſtlie, vſe and
experience it ſelfe, doth confirme vnto our ſoules, his prouidence,
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and goodnes towards vs.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Hence it appeareth, that Inuocation, which is that true
worſhip of God, is altogeather ouerthrowen in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Firſt of all, becauſe the Papiſtes doe teach men to
bring their owne merites, as that Phariſie did, although they are beholding
vnto God for them: The which doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine doth damme vp that eſpeciall ſpring
of true Prayer, namelie, the ſenſe of our want.</p>
            <p n="20">20 Next, that they either bring in fained promiſes, or
inuent merites that haue no promiſe.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Thirdlie, in that they profeſſedlie place doubting in
ſtead of faith: as though to bee aſſured that GOD will heare vs, were a
ſecuritie full of Preſumption.</p>
            <p n="22">22 Herevnto is to bee adjoyned, that both they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
priuate and publicke prayer, in a ſtraunge vnknown tongue: (which is nothing
elſe but a manifeſt mocking of God,) and that they pray by nomber.
Brieflie, in that they teach, (which is vtterlie wicked) that thoſe prayers
of theirs, doe deſerue remiſsion of ſinnes, and other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites.</p>
            <p n="23">23 To be ſhort, herein they are moſt godleſſe, in
that they appoint Saints departed, as ſubſtitute interceſſours vnder
Chriſt, not onelie raſhlie and in vaine, beſides and contrarie to the
word of God, and therfore without faith; but alſo vnprofitablie, ſeeing
that cannot bee held, but they muſt make the Spirits of thoſe that are
dead, to be the ſearchers of harts, and attribute vnto them, that which is 
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1885:108"/> proper vnto GOD onelie: namelie, that they may heare
thoſe that call vpon them euery where.</p>
            <p n="24">24 This ſinne is augmented euen by an other two-fold
impietie: the one, in that they honor the Virgine MARIE, and the ſigne of the
Croſſe, by a certaine peculier inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the other, in that they doe
yeeld vnto Images both painted and grauen, the verie ſame worſhip, whereby
they would honour Chriſt, if he were preſent.</p>
            <p n="25">25 Touching thoſe degrees of their religious adoration by
LATRIA, DVLIA, and HYPERDVLIA, wee affirme them to be altogether vaine.</p>
            <p n="26">26 Vaine alſo is that diſtinction, of the Mediator of
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and interceſsion.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>WE HAVE ABOVE IN THE LAST TENTH Principle made mention of a forme
of inuocation, or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and therefore hauing alreadie ſpoken of the reſt
of the cauſes thereof, wee nowe come to the interpretation of the ſaid
forme, out of the words of Chriſt. Math. 6. Luke, 11. which is therefore
commonlie called, the Lords Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 THis forme teacheth vs moſt compendiouſlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but
yet moſt abſolutelie, whatſoeuer wee are to aske of God generallie as it

               <head>1. The Preface, OVR FATHER VVHICH ART IN HEAVEN.</head>
               <p n="4">4 FATHER.] This word doth firſt of all teach vs the
foundation of our faith: namelie, the diſtinction of the perſons, for the
FATHER is one, the SONNE is an other.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Theſe petitions are directed vnto the perſon of the
Father, that therby not onelie the diſtinction, but alſo the order of the
perſons may be expreſſed: the firſt whereof is the Father, the
ſecond, is the Sonne of the Father; and the third is the holie Ghoſt, of
the Father and the Sonne.</p>
               <p n="6">6 When as therefore we cal vpon the Sonne, our minds ſtaie
not in him, but aryſe from him vnto the Father, as we are led by the holie
Ghoſt vnto the Father and the Son. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwais, as the perſons vnto whom the
worſhip of inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is directed, are not ſeparated, ſo is not the
ſaid worſhip to be ſeuerallie conſidered, but onelie diſtinctlie:
ſeing the ſame reuerence is aequallie due vnto al the 3. perſons, as to
the one and the ſelf-ſame God.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Moreouer, this moſt ſweet name of a FATHER doth
regarde vs alſo: ſeeing wee doe not call vpon the Father, as the Father of
the Sonne onelie, but euen as vppon our Father.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Againe, this word doth ſet down the other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
our truſt: namelie, that hee who is the Father of Chriſt, is alſo ours,
though in a diuers reſpect.</p>
               <p n="9">9 For he is the Father of Chriſt, 1. by nature onlie, in
reſpect that the Sonne is Coeſſentiall with the Father. 2. 
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1885:109"/> In reſpect that his humanity being conceaued by the
holy Ghoſt, dooth by perſonall vnion, ſubſiſt in that aeternall Sonne
of God.</p>
               <p n="10">10 But he is our Father in reſpect of Adoption, that is,
in regarde that he doth vouchſafe vs, being ſpirituallie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed into
Chriſt by Faith, to be called children, as thoſe whome (being elected in
him) he juſtifieth, &amp; will one day glorifie.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Therefore, this worde teacheth vs againe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
in the Father through the Sonne, muſt go before our Prayers: the which if it
bee not preſent, prayers are not only not acceptable, but euen ſins in the
preſence of God.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Wee are alſo by this meanes taught, that if we will be
heard, we are bound to come in the preſence of God, not onlie wihout anie
conſideration of our merites (which can be none at all) but contrariwiſe,
that we conceaue our prayers, truſting in his onelie free Adoption and mercie
in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Laſtly, this word FATHER, doth require that we pray
vnto God, with a true ſenſe of our ſinnes paſt, and a firme purpoſe
to amend our liues, otherwiſe our prayers are in vaine. For the impudencie
were not tollerable, to call him Father, whome wee are not ſorie that wee
haue offended, and whome euer after, wee meant not to feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>OVR.</p>
               <p n="14">14 This doth put vs in mind of 2. things, (both being of
great moment in true Praier) 1. of our Adoption, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee haue ſpoken:
whereby it commeth to paſſe, that he who hath that onelie Sonne by nature,
coaeternall with himſelf, doth account vs his ſonnes adopted in him:
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whome there is no ſaluation, nor anie true confidence in calling
vpon God. 2. That true loue is to bee joined with faith: that as the Father,
who is but one, is yet in his Sonne, the common Father of all the faithfull:
ſo we ſhuld think, that they cannot be acknowledged for ſonnes, who are
not in loue with their brethren: otherwiſe, they ſhould 
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1885:110"/> bee accounted to bee in the bodie, who ſeuer
themſelues from the members thereof, which cannot be.</p>
               <p n="15">15 This conjunction conſiſteth partlie in the agrement
of doctrine and religion, partlie in the affections. And therefore, before we
can trulie call vpon God, we muſt be members of the Catholicke Church, and
haue a regarde to maintaine peace, and concord one with another, in ſuch
ſort, as all vnkindnes and hatred being laid aſide, we muſt pray from our
hearts, euen for our enemies.</p>
               <p n="16">16 But this conjunction ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be perfect, while we liue
heere. For all of vs know but in part; and often not in the ſame part; now in
reſpect of mutuall liuing together; there is none; but in ſome thinges, hee
ſheweth himſelfe to be a man: But as the imperfection of faith, doth not
hinder the effect thereof, the ſame is to be ſaid of our mutuall
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both in Religion, and alſo in affections: ſo that wee be
diſpleaſed with our ſelues for thoſe our imperfections, and be more and
more deſirous of a growth in our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Seeing this communion of faith, doeth not onelie
comprehend the elect, that are alreadie indued with faith: and ſtriue
togeather with vs in this life, againſt ſinne; But euen thoſe that are to
beleeue, and lying as yet vncalled, knowne onelie vnto God, our prayers alſo
doe belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
               <p n="18">18 But as for thoſe whoſe Spirits are already gathered
with Chriſt, and whoſe bodies are a ſleepe in the graue, our Praiers for

that from hence did ariſe by little and little, both inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dead

whollie in himſelf, preſeruing and gouerning all his creatures, &amp; not

               <p n="21">21 He is then ſaid to be IN HEAVEN, that thereby his

reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect: namelie, in that the three former of them, do direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie regarde
the glorie of God, and the three latter do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie concerne vs, they may bee
fitlie comprehended in a diuiſion of two members.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Although then, there is nothing appertaining vnto Gods
glorie, whence ſome profit dooth not redound vnto the godly: &amp; thogh
alſo, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rightly craue none of thoſe things which belong vnto our
ſaluation, but we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them for the glorie of God: yet it
behoueth vs in theſe things, to be affected in a diuers ſort: namelie, that
in the one, we haue a reſpect onelie to the glorie of God, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding our
owne behoofe: and that in the other, wee ſo reſpect our owne eſtate, that
we be alſo eſpeciallie minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Gods glorie, which we are bound to
promote.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Theſe petitions moreouer, which belong vnto Gods glorie,
are juſtlie placed in the firſt rancke. For Chriſt ſaith<note place="margin">Mat. 6.33.</note> Seeke firſt the kingdome of God and the
righteouſneſſe thereof, and all theſe things ſhall be giuen vnto you.
And this order is obſerued alſo in the commandementes: for the firſt
place is yeelded vnto thoſe which properlie apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto the worſhip of
God, whereas thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the maintenance of loue betweene man and
man, do follow in the ſecond rancke.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Among the former petitions, it is not without cauſe that
HALLOVVED BE THY NAME is the firſt. For although the end of them bee, that
Gods glorie may ſhine euerie where, as it ought: yet the order of teaching
doth require that that ſhould be accounted the firſt petition, which
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the firſt degree of his glorie: whereunto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is
adjoined, which ſheweth the meanes to augment <pb n="204" facs="tcp:1885:112"/> the
ſame, and the third next vnto that, which declareth the way to the
accompliſhing and finiſhing thereof.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Touching the firſt, we place not the name of Ieſus in
the verie notes of the letters, or in the vocall pronouncing of the word. For
the former were Iewiſh, as the latter is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, where the name of Ieſus
is not vttered, without the yeelding of ſome ſuperſtitious reuerence
thervnto, and the kiſsing of the letters themſelues.</p>
            <p n="9">9 But by the name of GOD, wee vnderſtand God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or
the Majeſtie, juſtice, mercie, goodnes, truth, power, and holines of God,
and the reſt of the attributes whereby he hath made himſelfe knowen in the
world.</p>
            <p n="10">10 In this Petition therefore, we intreat, that the glory of
God, may according to the majeſtie therof, be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and celebrated
amongeſt men heere vppon earth. Brieflie, that the honor and worſhip due
vnto God, may be yeelded vnto him in this world: on the other-ſide we wiſh,
that all thoſe things may be remooued, ouerthrowen, and cleane taken away,
which doe profane, diminiſh, or obſcure the ſaid glory of God, either in
himſelfe, in his workes, or in his word &amp; doctrine: So that this Petition
is anſwerable vnto the commandement: [Thou ſhalt not take the name of God
in vaine.] For heere is commanded that which is there forbidden.</p>
            <p n="11">11 This Petition is ſo ſtrictly enjoyned vnto vs, that we
cannot omitte the ſame without hainous wickednes. For what is more vnworthie,
then that either our ingratitude and blindnes ſhould obſcure, or boldnes
and furious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as farre as lieth in it, blot out the ſame?</p>
            <p n="12">12 But although all the wicked, with their ſacrilegious
luſt ſhoulde flie a ſunder for ſpite; yet ſhall the holines of Gods
name ſhine &amp; gliſter. For thus the prophet crieth out; [As thy name
ô God, ſo doth thy praiſe extend vnto al the ends of the earth;] for
wherſoeuer the Lord maketh himſelf knowen, it cannot be, but his vertue,
power, goodnes, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, juſtice, mercy, and truth ſhould manifeſt
themſelues, whereby wee might be drawen vnto the admiration of his
majeſtie, and ſtirred vp to ſet forth his praiſes.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:1885:112"/>13 But, in aſmuch as GOD is ſo
vnworthily robbed of his holines vpon earth, we ar bidden, if we haue not power
to maintaine the ſame; yet at the leaſt, to vnder-take the care thereof in
our praiers, as it is meet we ſhould, althogh of it ſelfe, it can neither
increaſe nor be diminiſhed.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Whoſoeuer therefore doe obſcure the holines of God, or
ſuffer the ſame to bee obſcured, as farre as in them lieth, they ſinne
againſt this petition, and are moſt heauily guiltie of Gods judgement.</p>

LXVI.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>HAVING EXPOVNDED THE FIRST PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, which declareth the firſt
ſtep of Gods glorie: wee are nowe to addreſse our ſelues, to the opening
of the ſecond, which ſetteth downe the meanes to augment the ſame.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 THis Petition, THY KINGDOME COME, beeing put in the ſecond
place by Chriſt, is juſtly ſet before the third: For as to beare rule, is
in nature before the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof; ſo is it meet, that the Lord would
firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his kingdome among vs, and then make vs obedient
therevnto.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For the wil of God cannot be performed, but by that power,
which he doth exerciſe in his ſaid kingdome.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Nowe as touching the expoſition of the Petition, the Lord
is ſaid to raigne, when as men hauing denied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, doe wholie
ſubmit them vnto him.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The principall ſcope then of this Petition is, that the
Lord will conſume and abolliſh all the luſts which fight in our members
againſt his wil: and that he would frame and faſhion vs, and all our
faculties vnto the obedience of his will.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:1885:113"/>5 Now whereas al men, from the higheſt
to the loweſt, are blinde by nature, and vnderſtand not what the will of
GOD is; and ſeeing it is the office of a King, to appoint lawes for his
ſubjects; we craue alſo, that God would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his will vnto the
world, and would plant the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his word, (which it pleaſeth him
to vſe as a Scepter, for the graunting of the thinges that are contained in
this Petition) throughout all the partes of the worlde, that by meanes thereof,
hee may gather togeather, thoſe whom hee hath elected from all aeternitie;
and on the other ſide may ouerthrow them, who as farre as they can, doe
hinder this worke.</p>
            <p n="6">6 So, wee affirme, that it is the right of God, alone to rule,
this kingdome by his owne lawes; that is, by the lawe and the Goſpel,
wherevnto no man can add or detract any thing, without high treaſon againſt
the ſupreame Majeſtie of God.</p>
            <p>The Pope then, and all his followers, who haue preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to
impoſe laws vpon the conſciences, are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Petition.</p>
            <p n="7">7 We deſire furthermore, that he would ſend faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſeruants, to declare this word purely and ſincerely, and that he would
driue away all falſe Teachers, and Prophets, who go about by their owne
inuentions, to draw others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the will of God.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But in aſmuch as that worde, barely expounded by man,
would rather turne vnto our damnation, then ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (for our judgement is
meere contrarye vnto Gods will, and our will doth turne away, euen from the
knowen will of God:) wee deſire that the Lord would vouchſafe to engraffe
the ſame in our mindes, by the force and efficacie of the holie Ghoſt, that
the true light may ſhine in them.</p>
            <p n="9">9 And ſeeing we can by no meanes fully obtaine theſe
thinges in this world, as beeing compelled to carrie about with vs, the
reliques of ſinne, euen vnto our dying day: we do therefore deſire that
that day may come, wherein Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, ſinne, and death being ſubdued, the
Lord ſhall be all in all: whence it may be eaſilie gathered, how
ſenſſeſſe they <pb n="207" facs="tcp:1885:113"/> are, that flie this day as a
fearefull thing.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Out of all theſe things, we may readily collect, that a
ſpirituall, and not an earthly kingdome is here ſpoken of, as alſo our
Lord Ieſus doth witneſſe,<note place="margin">Iohn. 18.36.</note> becauſe
it is exerciſed both by GOD who is a Spirite, and alſo vpon the
conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The neceſsitie of this Petition doth firſt appeare, in
that Sathan ſeeketh nothing els, but to erect the kingdom of darknes and
confuſion, (which is meere contrarie vnto this) amongſt men: For the which
cauſe, hee is called the Prince and God of this world.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Heere vnto is adjoyned, our naturall infection, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with our corrupt judgement and peruerſe wil, who preferre lies before the
truth, ſinne before righteouſnes, earthly before ſpiritual, moſt euill
before good, and vnjuſt before right thinges; and in ſome, who cannot bee
ſubject vnto the law of God.</p>
            <p n="13">13 But although, the Deuill and wicked men do runne madde,
yet the Lorde doth and will exerciſe his gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well vpon them as
vppon the elect: (For who can bee exempted from his authoritie, who hath
created all thinges?) yet in a diuers manner. For hee imbraceth the one with
his eternall fauour, whereas he conſumeth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his fearefull
wrath.</p>
            <p n="14">14 And if God be properly ſaid to beare rule, when as men
do willinglie ſubmit themſelues vnto him: he ſinneth moſt greeuouſly,
who vnder the pretence that GOD doth already rule both the godlie and the

            <head>PRINCIPLES TOVCHING THE THIRD PETITION OF THE LORDS PRAIER.
LXVII.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>HAVING OPENED TWO OF THE PETI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Lordes Praier, which
doe immediatlie reſpect the glorie of God: wee doe now come vnto the
expoſition of the third.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 THis Petition [THY VVIL BE DONE IN EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN]
is the third in order of thoſe whereof we haue ſpoken, becauſe that no
man doth obey the will of God, being made known and commanded, ſaue onely
thoſe, who acknowledge God for their king.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſumme or ſcope of this Petition is, that the will of
God may be performed vpon earth by men, who know the ſame, and loue it from
their hearts, as it is done by the bleſſed Angels in heauen.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The aequitie of it, is vnderſtoode by the praeface: For
God is ſaid to bee in Heauen, which ſignifieth power and authoritie, and to
be our Father, both in regard of the firſt creation of al men, and alſo, of
the redemption of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; whence it followeth, that we being his
ſeruants and ſonnes, are bound to know &amp; willingly to practiſe the
will of our Lord and Father.</p>
            <p n="4">4 This Petition is neceſſarie, becauſe our fleſhe
beeing bond-ſlaue vnto ſinne and Sathan, is contrary heerevnto: Now the
more impediments that do hinder vs to perform the will of God, the more
earneſt ought wee to be in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſtrength to practiſe the ſame. It
is alſo neceſſary, to the end, that wee periſh not; but may be made
Citizens of the kingdome of God; which cannot be, vnleſſe wee obey his
will; not that the obedience of the ſame doth make vs free-men of his
kingdome, but in aſmuch as it declareth, that we haue bene made the Citizens
thereof.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The parts of this Petition, as being a perfect ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1885:114"/> or two; that which is opened, and that which doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
The former containeth our prayer for the execution of Gods will: the latter
ſetteth downe a ſimilitude, which ſheweth, how wee deſire the ſame to
be performed here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Let vs therefore, diligently examine euerie worde of the
Petition: Firſt the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
offereth it ſelfe, which according vnto the accuſtomed maner of ſpeaking
amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Chriſtians, is expreſſed by the worde WILL, though that will
bee of a more large ſignification then
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now the word WILL, doth not ſignifie the facultie or
action of willing, which in God differeth nothing from his eſſence, but it
pointeth out thoſe thinges which GOD willeth, by a Metynomie of the adjunct
put for the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The things which God willeth, are of two ſortes: For
ſome of them, are of that nature, that they are good of themſelues, by the
goodnes which God hath put into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: others of them are good by accident, or
for the end that God hath appointed, who can bring foorth good out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
and light out of darknes.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Again, ſome of thoſe things that God willeth, hath he
made known vnto vs; others hath he reſerued to himſelfe: whence ſome of
the ancients, and alſo of the School-men made the wil of God to be in part,
<hi>voluntatem beneplaciti,</hi> that is his free, vnbounded or ſecret will,

euery one, which are briefly comprehended vnder the name of the Law and the

            <p n="10">10 Now wee are to deale in this place, with that which is
called the ſignified will, becauſe that only is perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which

is concerning thoſe <pb n="210" facs="tcp:1885:115"/> things which are good of

            <p n="11">11 Wheras THY VVIL (&amp; not anothers or euery mans) is

            <p n="12">12 The word [BE DONE] that is, be fulfilled, doth teach vs,
that we are to obey Gods will, with the whole affection of our ſoule, with
all our mind and thoughts.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Whereas it is ſet down paſsiuelie [BE DONE] it
ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that it may bee gathered thereby, that man before the firſt
grace, is onelie conſidered paſsiuelie, as beeing to bee wrought vppon, but
not working; ſo that, euen to will what is right, is giuen of God: Next wee
gather, that after the firſt grace, the continuaunce of willing that which is
good, and the perfection therof, is in the hand of GOD onelie; euen thence that
we are commanded to craue, that Gods will may be done; whereas wee doe not
craue thoſe things that are in our owne power.</p>
            <p n="14">14 BE DONE IN EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN] the word HEAVEN and
EARTH, are to bee vnderſtood Metonymical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which doth containe beeing

            <p n="15">15 The will of God vpon earth, is in deede performed onelie
by men: vnleſſe a man will referre the word OBEY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, Metaphorically vnto
other creatures: yet not by all men, but by them onely who are regenerated:
Although, as AVGVSTINE ſaith, the will of God is doone concerning (but not
by) the reſt.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Now, becauſe humaine frailty, (which by Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
doth alwaies cleaue vnto man in this life) can beare no more; it commeth to

            <p n="17">17 Neither is there any more then this, meant by the

an ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall qualitie, but a likenes, and an agreement therein: not that the

expedient for vs.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The neceſsitie, or rather the aequitie of this petition is
manifold: Firſt it teacheth vs, that we ought wholly to depend vpon Gods
Prouidence, by whome we are nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, maintained and preſerued.
Secondlie, that wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him the giuer of all good things both
ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and temporall. Thirdlie, that we may with quiet minds expect
thoſe things at his handes, which otherwiſe would holde vs in a miſerable
care and perplexity.</p>
            <p n="7">7 For our mercifull Father dooth not diſdaine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
our bodies into his protection and cuſtodie, that by theſe ſmall thinges,
hee may exerciſe our faith, when as wee looke for all thinges at his handes,

               <item>I. The Marcionites and Manichaees therefore are out of their
wits, who haue endeuored to defend that God hath no care of theſe our bodies,
as though the ſame were vnbeſeeming his Majeſtie: and that our fleſhe
or our bodies, were the worke not of God, but of an euill beginning, that is,
of the Diuell, and therefore that it became not the good God to ſuſtaine
them, ſeeing they are euill.</item>
               <item> II. They are madd alſo who thinke, that all thinges are
diſpoſed by the toſsing of Fortune. And the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures alſo, togeather

            <p n="8">8 But now we come to examine the words of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions: the
word [BREAD] is taken in this place, neither ſimplie, nor Metaphoricallie,

            <head>PRINCIPLES TOVCHING THE FIFT PETITION OF THE LORDS PRAIER.
LXIX.</head>
            <p n="1">1. SEeing, we haue in the former Principles made the ſecond
part of the Lordes Praier to be two-folde, ſo that the things contained
therein, were ſhewed to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corporall or ſpirituall: It followeth,
that hauing alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die dealt with the corporall, we now come to the handling of
the ſpirituall things.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Now, all the ſpirituall things which belong vnto our
ſaluation, and which Chriſt teacheth vs to ſeeke at Gods hands, are
referred vnto true repentaunce; the which as it hath two parts; ſo the ſame
is contained in two Petitions.</p>
            <p n="3">3 True repentance conſiſteth firſt, in that wee bewaile
our ſinnes, and by faith deſire them to be done away: next, that we be
careful not to commit thoſe things againe. The former of theſe is contained
in this fift, the latter in the next, which is the laſt Petition.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The neceſsitie of this Petition, is no leſſe then the
aequitie of it: For ſeeing all men, by reaſon of their ſins, are ſo
hatefull in the ſight of God, that they can haue no hope of aeternall life,
except the Lord pardon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their offences: ſurely, there is none but may
ſee, what gret neceſsity ther is of this Petition: whoſoeuer therefore
deſireth to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, <pb n="217" facs="tcp:1885:118"/> he is to know, that this
petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is very needful for him</p>
            <p n="5">5 The reaſon of the aequitie of it is the ſame, for there
is nothing more aequall, then that wee ſhould daily craue the remiſsion and
pardon of our ſins, at the handes of our mercifull God, whome we continually
offend.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I We cannot therefore but condemne the Pelagians, who thought
that this Petition was to bee vſed for modeſties cauſe: the which
modeſtie is nothing els, but blaſphemous impudencie.</item>
               <item> II We deteſt alſo, the madnes of the Catheriſts,
Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtinians, Anabaptiſts, and all ſuch monſters, who drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
themſelues to be perfect and free from all ſpot of ſinne, do deny, that
they haue any need of this Petition.</item>
               <item> III And the Nouatians, who leaue no hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, vnto
them that haue fallen into any ſinne, after that they haue once receiued
Baptiſme.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="6">6 This Petition, that we may come vnto the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar opening

craue, namely the free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of all our ſinnes whatſoeuer they bee,
by and for, Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p n="7">7 There are foure things then contained in this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1.
a confeſsion of our ſinnes, who haue made vs guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of aeternall death.
2. The great patience and clemency of God towardes vs is commended, who doth
not onelie beare with vs, who daily offend him, but alſo doth pardon euery
one of vs, ſo many ſinnes. 3. Out of the proper ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the

               </gap> FORGIVE, we gather that the

               </gap> DEBT, which the Syrians call
CHIBAH, doeth teach vs, that all our ſinnes, (which are heere figuratiuelie
and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the propriety of the Syrian tong, called DEBTS, are whollie
forgiuen vs.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts therefore, are mad with their merits, and
diſtinctions betweene the puniſhment and the offence, between mortall and
veniall ſinnes, as they define them; though we doe not denie ſome ſins to
bee greater then others; and who flie vnto their ſatisfactions, as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1885:119"/> that their ſins are not wholie done away by Chriſt
onely.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Vs] Chriſt would haue vs to vſe this worde, to the end
we might learne, not onely to be carefull of our owne ſaluation, but alſo
of our brethrens: and this is true loue, which is ſo much commended vnto
vs.</p>
            <p n="9">9 In the other part of this Petition, we are taught what our
dutie is.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Namely, that following the example of our moſt mercifull
Father, we ſhould trulie forgiue all treſpaſſes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that haue
offended vs, which is one of the ſpeciall effects of true loue.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Now this ſecond part is added, that we may rightly craue
the remiſsion of our ſinnes, and ſo may come vnto prayer with true faith
and repentance; the marke whereof, is loue towards our neigbour.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Neither are we bound, onely to forgiue thoſe that haue
offended vs: but euen to loue them no leſſe then our ſelues.</p>
            <p n="13">13 The word AS, doth not paint out the cauſe, degree, or
aequalitie of the forgiuing, proceeding from vs, with the remiſsion which wee
craue at Gods hand: but it ſetteth downe the reſemblaunce thereof after a
ſort, and our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes therevnto.</p>
            <p n="14">14 This worde then is added as a ſigne, whereby wee might
be confirmed, that God hath ſo certainlie forgiuen vs our ſinnes, as we are
aſſured, that we haue forgiuen our neighbours, and that we are voyd of all
hatred, enuie, and reuenge.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Now we forgiue our neighbours their ſinnes, as far as
they concerne vs, and not in regard that they haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, whome hee
eſpeciallie offendeth, whoſoeuer hee be, that treſpaſſeth againſt
his neighbour.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Whoſoeuer then, deſireth his ſinnes to be forgiuen
him, and hath not forgiuen his neighbour; or hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen him in words,
doth intend to be yet reuenged: hee doth againe deſire, that God would not
remit him his ſins, but to take puniſhment of them.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:1885:119"/>17 Yet is it lawfull for a Chriſtian,
to ſeeke redreſſe by the Magiſtrate, of the injurie that is done vnto
him, both that thereby, the ſocietie of men may bee preſerued, and that
lewd men be not incouraged to abuſe the patience of the good; but yet ſo,
as all deſire of priuate reuenge, and al offence be auoyded.</p>
            <p>Wrongfully therefore, did IVLIAN the Apoſtata ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of this

LXX.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>HAVING DONE WITH THE FIVE FIRST Petitions of the Lords Prayer: the
ſixt and the laſt is now to be opened.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 THis laſt Petition, is rightly placed after all the
reſt; and eſpecially next after the firſt. For firſt, ſeeing wee doe
heere alſo craue of our God, thoſe thinges which make for our ſaluation:
order requireth, that after we haue in the former Petition, begged the
remiſsion of our ſinnes, we ſhould heere deſire the ſtrength of the
Spirit, whereby, wee might bee daily enabled to ſtand againſt all
temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For although our ſinnes are forgiuen vs, yet are wee neuer
ſo cleared of them, but the reliques of the fleſh doe ſtill remaine in
vs, whereby our aduerſarie doeth driue vs vnto diuers ſinnes. Wherefore wee
deſire, that the Lorde would not ſuffer vs to be ouercome by the Deuill,
and the luſts of our fleſh, which doe continuallie warre againſt vs.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Nowe becauſe wee wraſtle not with fleſh and blood,
that is, with thoſe enemies, which we are able to gainſt and by our owne
ſtrength: but againſt the powers of the Aire, <pb n="220" facs="tcp:1885:120"/> that
is, againſt Sathan himſelfe, who doth continuallie as a roaring Lyon lie in
wait for vs, and prouoke vs to ſin: this Petition is altogeather
neceſſarie for vs, that thereby wee may obtaine ſpirituall armour at Gods
hands.</p>
            <p n="4">4 This requeſt conſiſteth of two partes; the Petition it
ſelfe and the declaration thereof: The Petition is, LEAD VS NOT INTO
TEMPTATION.] the declaration of it is, [BVT DELIVER VS FROM EVIL.]</p>
            <p n="5">5 In theſe wordes, [LEAD VS NOT, &amp;c.] is ſhewed, that
neither the Deuill himſelfe, nor any other aduerſarie can doe ought
againſt vs, but by the Lordes permiſision, and as farre as he will permit
them.</p>
            <p n="6">6 By the worde LEAD, as alſo by many other that are found in
the Scripture, (as to harden, to deliuer vp into a reprobate ſenſe,
&amp;c.) is not ment a bare permiſsion of God onely (as ſome thinke,) but a
permiſsion joyned with the decree and ordinance of God, who doth vſe the
woorke of Sathan, and the concupiſcence of men, either for the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
of ſin with ſin, or for the chaſtiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his children.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now the Lorde is ſaid to lead thoſe into temptation,
whom in his juſt judgement, he giueth ouer vnto ſathan, or their own
wils.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Neither are wee for this cauſe to thinke, that God is the
Author of ſinne: for what ſo euer he willeth, the ſame doth hee will
juſtlie and holilie, and his action euen in that temptation wherevnto men do
yeeld, is altogeather with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, wheras the action of Sathan, and
thoſe that obey him, is both vnjuſt and altogeather ſinfull.</p>
            <p>It is without cauſe therefore, that ſome doe gather out of this
doctrin, that we make God to be the author of ſinne.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Neither are we taught ſimplie to pray, that we be not
tempted at all, but that wee bee not lead into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For it profiteth vs
to bee ſometimes tempted, but we pray, that wee be not ouercome of the
temptation, and ſo offend God.</p>
            <p n="10">10 The word TEMPTATION, or to TEMPT, is of a double
ſignification: for ſometimes it ſignifieth to ſift or to trie, 
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1885:120"/> and ſometimes to lead vnto euill. God therefore is
ſaide one way to tempt, and Sathan another. Sathan, that hee may deſtroy,
condemne, and ouerthrow; but God to the end that by trying his, he may ſee
what ſtrength is in them not becauſe God knoweth not what is man; but
partlie to teach his children to knowe themſelues, and partlie that he may
manifeſt the hypocrites.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Now there are diuers and almoſt infinite ſortes of
temptations: for ſome of them are raiſed within vs onelie by our owne
concupiſcence, which afterward are augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Sathan: others are
adminiſtred vnto our concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence by the wonderfull deluſions of
Sathan: Againe, wee are ſometimes prouoked vnto wickednes from the right
hand, that is, by flatteries, and the falſe reſemblaunce of right and
profite; otherwhiles from the left, that is, by threats and terrors.</p>
            <p n="12">12 And from all theſe doe wee deſire, that our God would
deliuer vs, by enabling vs with his ſtrength: that ſo dwelling vnder his
protection and defence, we may firmlie ſtand againſt all the aſſaults
of Sathan.</p>
            <p n="13">13 So the worde DELIVER, doeth admoniſh vs of our
weakeneſſe, and ignorance. For, if wee were able by our owne ſtrength to
withſtand temptations, wee ſhoulde not ſtand in need to craue ſtrength
and aide elſe where: This our deliuerance from ſinne then, is not in our
ſelues, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it depend vpon our ſelues, but onelie vppon the
ſtrength, grace, and mercie of God.</p>
            <p>Heere are confuted both the meere Pelagians, who dreame that Sathan
and our corruption, may be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by our owne ſtrength: and alſo the
half Pelagians the Papiſts, who imagine a concurring togeather of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and
of grace: and thoſe alſo who teach, that the grace of regeneration once
begun, is ſufficient for vs, to gaine the victorie.</p>
            <p n="14">14 For wee are borne the ſeruants of ſinne, and the grace
of regeneration beeing begun, ſtandeth in neede of the ſupport of new
graces, to confirm the ſame &amp; to make it effectuall.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:1885:121"/>15 Yet are not wee therefore turned
into ſtockes, that in gaining the victorie ouer Sathan, we ſhould bee
vſed as dead inſtruments onelie, ſeeing both to will and to do, is giuen
vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="16">16 It is not greatlie materiall, whether by the worde [EVILL]
in this place, wee vnderſtand the Diuell or ſinne dwelling in vs.</p>
            <p n="17">17 To conclude, we deſire in this petition, that we be not
ouerwhelmed by anie temptation; but contrariwiſe, that leaning vpon the power
of God, working within vs, ſinne and Sathan beeing ouercome, we may all our
daies, liue in true holineſſe.</p>

            <p n="4">4 And this is the moſt ſure foundation of our praiers,
when as we know that they are to be directed vnto GOD, vnto whome all power,
glorie, and dominion dooth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine.</p>
            <p n="5">5 For if our praiers were to bee commended vnto the Lord, in
our owne worthineſſe (which is none at all) there is no mortall man that
durſt (without ſingular temeritie) <pb n="223" facs="tcp:1885:121"/> ſo much as open
his lips, much leſſe, preſent his praiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his majeſtie.</p>
            <p n="6">6 But now, though we be moſt miſerable, and bare of all
thinges, yet can we not be deſtitute of ſufficient truſt &amp; confidence
in praier, ſeeing our Fathers kingdome, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and glorie, cannot be taken
away from him.</p>
            <p n="7">7 By the word [KINGDOME] is meant, the right and authoritie to
beare rule: this confeſsion then dooth attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto God, the moſt
ſoueraigne and free rule ouer all creatures, whereby he gouerneth euerie
where, and ouer all.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The POVVER which is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cioned in the ſecond place, doth
point out the abilitie and power to execute this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment: which power is
ſo ſoueraigne and ſo mightie, that nothing is able to reſiſt the
ſame. So that God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to giue vs all things, ſeeing hee hath this
power in his hand; which is alſo ioyned with exceeding mercie and
bountifulneſſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Thirdlie and laſtlie, by the word GLORIE is declared the
praiſe and honour of God, whereunto wee are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre all our thoughts and
deedes, as to their laſt and final end.</p>
            <p n="10">10 The word AMEN ſignifieth as much, as that which we aske
is ſure and certainlie ratified: neither is it adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a portion of the
praier, but to the end that it may both declare the ſinceare deſire and
affection, whereby we wiſh to be heard in Praier, and alſo may teſtifie
the ſtaied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our faith.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Seeing to giue thankes then, we ought to conſider
theſe three things, which this ſhort ſentence of Chriſt doth containe.
Firſt, that we remember thoſe peculiar benefits which we haue receaued at
Gods hand: as DAVID beeing deliuered from the danger of warre ſaith: [Thou
haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered mee Lord from death, and from the enemie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Next, that we aſcribe whatſoeuer we haue obtained to
haue proceeded from the meere liberalitie of God, and not to anie
worthineſſe or merites of our owne.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Brieflie, that thereby wee may be more and more 
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1885:122"/> confirmed in faith, and may be raiſed vp to the hope
of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing other, yea and greater benefites from his majeſty. For our God
is not wearie in dooing vs good.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Vnder this forme which is euerie way moſt perfect we
holde that there is contained, whatſoeuer we ought to ſeek at Gods hand,
ſo that it is to be accounted for the rule of all our praiers.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is not well done of the Latine Churches in that they
haue omitted this clauſe and end of the Lords Praier, though ſometimes they
vſe the ſame els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>

            <head>PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE SACRED MINISTERIE OF THE CHVRCH, VVHERE
THE DOCTRINE OF the Law &amp; the Goſpel are compared together. LXXII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 VVEE haue done with the true markes of the true Church: that
is, with the truth of Gods word, Sacraments and Praier: nowe becauſe that all
thinges are to bee orderlie done in the Church; it is meet that we ſet down,
how theſe things ought to bee admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We hold that as the truth of al the ſinceare doctrine that
doeth appertaine vnto aeternall life; ſo alſo the true manner of the
gouernment of the Church, was giuen from aboue by the holie Ghoſt: both vnto
the Fathers before the Lawe, and to MOSES in the wilderneſſe, and alſo
vnto the Apoſtles. And to be ſhort, that this truth touching do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and
gouernment, was moſt faithfullie &amp; moſt fullie ſet downe both by
MOSES and alſo by the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And although from the beginning vnto the end of the world,
there was, is, and ſhall bee but one doctrine of ſaluation, yet was there
not alwaies one &amp; the ſame forme of the diſpenſation thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:1885:122"/>4 For it pleaſed GOD at ſundrie
times and in diuers maners to make the ſaid doctrine known vnto the world:
according vnto the which diſpenſation, it was alſo neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to frame
the forme of the miniſterie thereof.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The principall and chief end therefore of the holie
Miniſterie in reſpect of ſaluation, was alwaies one: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the laying
open of Gods goodnes, touching the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, by meanes of the free
couenant made in Chriſt onelie: who both before, and vnder the rudiments of
the Law was ſhadowed, and manifeſted in deed in the fulneſſe of
time.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Yet of this holie miniſterie both before and vnder the
law, there were three generall parts; namely, to teach, to ſacrifice, to
bleſſe, as might be ſhewed by many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the ſcripture:
vnder the name of ſacrifice, we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, all ſorts of rites, as vnder
the name of bleſsing, wee containe publike prayers.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Of the holy doctrine there haue beene two kindes. namely,
the law, denouncing judgement and death; &amp; the Goſpell offering life,
freelie giuen vnto the repentant.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Yet is it not properlie the lawe, but the tranſgreſsion
thereof that doth kill.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The Legall ceremonies were certaine appurtenances both of
the law and the Goſpell, wherin as in a glaſſe, were to be ſeene,
though in a contrary regard, both the curſſe of the law, and alſo the
bleſsing of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The miniſtery of Moſes, notwithſtanding, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the miniſtery of the Goſpell, is for three cauſes called the
miniſtery of death. The one, becauſe that the lawe written, was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by
Moſes, whereby death was more manifeſtly layde before the eyes of
ſinners, then euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="12">12 The other, becauſe Moſes did labor much more in
ſetting downe the Lawe, then in opening the promiſes of the Goſpell; that
men might learne by the terrors thereof, to frame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-ſelues vnto the
receiuing of perfecter things, that were to be manifeſted at the time
appointed, and not place the hope of ſaluation in theſe rites. Thirdly,
becauſe <pb n="226" facs="tcp:1885:123"/> the Lawe indeed dooth point out the
diſeaſe that bringeth death, but doth not heale it; yea rather encreaſe
the ſame through our falt, in that it requireth of vs, the execution of the
Commandements, and giueth vs not abilitie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them.</p>
            <p n="12">12 But in the Goſpell (the picture whereof in a ſorte,
was that externall worſhippe of the Lawe) God giueth by his holy ſpirite,
the abilitie to performe the promiſe of the ſame, that is, the power to
repent and belieue. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preaching of the Goſpell, is called
the ſpirite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in our heartes, but the Lawe is tearmed the dead
letter, that is, a dead writing engrauen in Tables of Stone.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Wherefore the Miniſtery, not onely of the olde, but
alſo of the newe Teſtament, was ordained not by men; but by the Lord, who
both inſtructed, and alſo called both the Patriarches, and alſo Moſes
&amp; Aaron to exerciſe the ſame, and afterwarde declared to Moſes the
rule and the forme thereof, as hee would haue it executed among his people:
wherevnto it was not lawefull to adde, or to detract any thing.</p>
            <p n="14">14 And becauſe the Lord fore-ſawe the negligence and the
wickednes of the Prieſts, hee did therefore ordaine in the auncient Church
both before and vnder the lawe, not onely an ordinary (which vnder the lawe,
was eſpeciallie aſſigned vnto the Tribe of Leuy) but alſo an
extraordinary that is a Propheticall miniſterie: vnto whome the Prieſts and
Kings themſelues were to yeld obedience, and whoſe office was to teach the
whole people, partly by a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite expoſition of the lawe, and
partly by terrifiyng the diſobedient by fearfull Reuelationes of Gods
judgments, and comforting the godlie by moſt louing promiſes.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Their miniſterie was extraordinarie, for although there
were certaine colledges of Prophets, when and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it pleaſed God,
yet were they not apointed by man, neither did they leane vpon any ordinarie
calling: Briefly, God did enſpire with his Spirite whome it pleaſed him,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting therein, neither ſex nor calling.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Both theſe Miniſteries, did the Lorde promiſe vnto 
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1885:123"/> his people by MOSES, and withall ſhewed, how falſe
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets whome the people were to take heede of, might bee diſcerned from
the true, whome they were to heare.</p>
            <p n="17">17 The Lord ordained this Miniſterie of men, not that he
was compelled thereto by any neceſsitie, but that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he regarded mans
infirmitie.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Yet he neuer vſed it, in ſuch ſort, as hee would
giue his owne glorie therevnto, that is, the authoritie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thoſe
thinges, which the diuine power alone bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to paſſe: but he effecteth
externall things onely by his Miniſterie, performing thoſe thinges by his
owne inward power alone, which were declared vnto the ſenſes of the
hearers, by the outward miniſterie of men.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Therefore hee performeth what he thinkeh good inwardlie in
the vnderſtanding, and will of man, when and as often as it pleaſeth him,
even without the externall miniſterie: but he who ever neglecteth the
ordinarie mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, or by vnbeleefe doth ſeuere the inwarde force from
the outwarde adminiſtration; that man tempteth God &amp; ſheweth himſelf
vnworthie of his grace. But as for thoſe that any wiſe aſcribe the proper

ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, and even plaine Idolators.</p>

            <head>PRINCIPLES TOVCHING THE MINISTERS OF THE WORDE VNDER THE GOSPEL.
LXXIII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 BEcauſe God, by means of his Miniſters, from the
beginning of the world vnto this day, hath with the word of life ſuſtained
man being fallen: the order both of time and doctrine requireth, that ſeeing
we haue in the former Principles, ſpoken of the Miniſterie which God
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in his Church, both before and after the law: We now deale with that
Miniſtery, which Chriſt after the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing <pb n="228" facs="tcp:1885:124"/> of
the law, appointed in theſe laſt times, to be in the Chriſtian
Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And to the end that the ſumme and the truth of the whole
matter may be more clearely ſet downe: we affirme firſt of all, that there
are three ſortes of Eccleſiaſticall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to be gathered out of the
holie Scriptures. For ſome doe attend vpon the preaching of the word; of
which ſort, were Apoſtles, prophets, Euangeliſts, and at this day
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers: Others haue the ouerſight of the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and
right diſtribution of the Church goods. The third ſort, doe watch ouer the
manners of men in preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting offences, and preſeruing the right gouernement
of the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Chriſt therefore, as the Son and the ſoueraigne Lord and
gouernor of his Fathers houſe; did not only perfectlie ſet downe the
doctrine of the couenant, but alſo declared, by what callings hee would haue
his Fathers houſe, that is, the Church to be gouerned.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And therefore he himſelfe, as PAVLE ſaith, gaue for the
worke of the Miniſterie, and the knitting togeather of the Saints, ſome
Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, ſome Paſtors and
Teachers.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Neither is it to bee inferred, either that all theſe
cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings were ordained to bee perpetually in the Church: or yet on the other
ſide, that all of them were to continue, but onely for a time.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Now all theſe names, as alſo the name of Elders and
Deacons, are ſometimes in a general ſignification, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto al
thoſe who haue the miniſtery of the word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto them: and
ſometimes they do declare dictinct and peculiar functions, in which ſenſe
we take them in the treatiſe following.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Of theſe fiue, the three firſt were temporarie, hauing
alſo euery one of them a diſtinct Miniſterie, and they were peculiarlie
called Apoſtles, Euangeliſtes, and Prophets, as being appointed for the
planting of the Church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the worlde, by the publiſhing of the newe
couenant. The other two callinges were perpetuallie to remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1885:124"/> the laſt comming of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The chiefe and moſt excellent of all theſe, were the
twelue Apoſtles, (vnto whoſe number, PAVLE was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward called) as it
were the embaſſadors of God, who were elected and admitted neither of men,
neither by men, but of Chriſt immediatlie, that all of them being of equall
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie amongſt themſelues, ſhould become the Maiſter-workman of
the building, whereabout they were to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, beeing ſtrictlie tied
vnto no certaine congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="9">9 They therefore, as they were lead by the inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
the holie Ghoſt, or by ſome peculiar commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, traueling
thorow many countries, preached the grace of Chriſt euerie where vnto all
men, the which, they both confirmed with miracles, and ſealed by the
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments. They alſo committed the churches which
they had planted, to be gouerned by their Paſtors and Doctors, as time and
place would permit: this office being faithfullie performed by them, and they
being called out of this life, the Apoſtolicall calling alſo ceaſed.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Hence it appeareth, how vaine and deteſtable in all
godlie eares, is that voice of the Romiſhe Prelate, who is not affraid to
profeſſe himſelfe an Apoſtle, by vertue of his tyrannicall
ſucceſsion, and is not aſhamed vnder the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pretence of PETERS
Primacie, to call himſelfe, chief or Prince of the Apoſtles, (amongſt
whome there was none either greater or leſſer then other) and euen the
heade of the whole Church.</p>
            <p n="11">11 It is out of controuerſie, that all thoſe were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Prophetes, who by the inſpiration of Gods Spirit, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſawe and fore-told
things to come: whoſe calling before the comming of Chriſt, was (when the
Prieſts grew neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent) to direct the faith of the Saints vnto the
promiſed ſaluation, and alſo both to raiſe vp the godlie, &amp; to beat
down the diſobedient, by their diuine reuelations. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at the
beginning of the preaching of the Goſpell, they were called Prophets, who
were indued with a peculiar gift of reuelation or diuine wiſdome, wherwith
God would at <pb n="230" facs="tcp:1885:125"/> that time adorne his Church: of this ſort
was AGABVS, &amp; the foure daughters of PHILIP the Euangeliſt, mentioned in
the Acts of the Apoſtles, and others vndoubtedlie not a few.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Sometimes notwithſtanding the woorde PROPHET and
Propheſying in the Scriptures, are taken in a manifold ſenſe, and
ſignifie all thoſe in generall who execute the function of the Paſtor.
For in this ſenſe the Apoſtle ſaith, He that propheſieth aedifieth
the Church, exhorteth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth, reproueth the contrarie doctrine.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Vnder the name EVANGELISTS are vnderſtood thoſe whome
the Apoſtles vſed as their companions and fellow labourers, becauſe they
themſelues were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie able to performe euerie work in all the
Churches, of this ſort was TIMOTHIE and TITVS, SILVANVS and others.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Now their office was to performe the worke begun or
otherwiſe committed vnto them by the Apoſtles, as it is manifeſt
eſpeciallie out of the Epiſtles of PAVLE to TIMOTHY, and TITVS: whoſe
calling was alſo temporarie. Thoſe foure in like ſort are called
Euangeliſts in a more ſtrict ſignification, whoſe ſeruice the Lord
vſed for the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſtorie of the Goſpell, and deſcribing the
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p n="15">15 There remaine two callings belonging to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie
of the word: to wit, Paſtors and Doctors; who are diſtinguiſhed from the
former, in a three-fold reſpect: firſt in that they are not immediatlie,
but haue bene euer ſince the time of the Apoſtles, ordained by the
miniſtery of men according vnto that forme whereof wee ſhall ſpeake.
Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, in that they are tied vnto a certain congregation: laſtlie,
becauſe the Lord hath ordained both theſe functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be perpetuall in
the Church.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The proper &amp; the peculiar function of the Doctor, is
to teach the doctrine of true Religion, by the faithfull interpreting of the
Scriptures, to defend the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the gainſayers, and to gouerne
the Eccleſiaſticall ſchooles.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:1885:125"/>17 Nowe the Miniſterie of Paſtors,
as of the Prieſt in times paſt, conſiſteth in three points: Firſt not
onlie in the ſimple laying open of the propheticall and appoſtolicall
doctrine which wee ſayd to bee the office of the Doctors, but alſo both in
the priuate and publick aplication therof by ſinceare and diligent teaching,
reproouing, correcting, and inſtructing: Next in the adminiſtration of the
Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are come in place of the legall rites; brieflie, in
conceauing publick prayers, which is not the leſt part of the
Eccleſiaſticall miniſterie.</p>
            <p n="18">18 The adminiſtration of the worde alſo is committed vnto
the Elders peculiarlie ſoe called, (whome Paul doeth eſpecially
expreſſe by the name of gouerners) but not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to that end, for the
which it is committed vnto the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and doctors. For they doe not
adminiſter the worde either publicklie vnto the whole congregation, or
priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vnto ſome: but haue authoritie to adminiſter the
eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall cenſures together with the Paſtors, by reprouing,
rebuking and binding, if necesſitie ſo require, thoſe, who by due tryal
are found to walk inordinatly in the Church, being ſuch as cannot be
otherwiſe amended; which is don not that ſinners ſhould periſh, but
contrariwiſe that being humbled at leaſt by ſhame, they may returne into
the right way.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Theſe together with the Paſtors (though
diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by their function as wee ſaid) are ſome times called by
a generall and common name of Biſhoppes, overſeers rulers; and that in
reſpect of the flocke, which they are to rule and gouerne.</p>
            <p n="20">20 DEACONS peculiarlie ſo called, are thoſe, who haue the
charge both of the receauing and alſo of the orderlie diſtribution of the
almes, and the adminiſtration of the reſt of the Church-goods: and the
applying of them to the neceſsitie of the poore, &amp; other holie vſes:
amongſt which number in times paſt were reckoned the companie of wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
beeing appointed eſpeciallie for the manifold ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsities of the
poore.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Nowe, it is vnlawfull for anie man to intermeddle 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1885:126"/> with theſe holie functions, except he be rightlie
called: &amp; a lawfull calling is that, whereby (according to the order
inſtituted by Chriſt) anie man, of whoſe life and doctrine there hath
bene a diligent and a preciſe examination had, is by the Church whereunto he
is appointed, (the name of God beeing in all ſingleneſſe and ſinceritie
called vpon) choſen, as it were, by the voice of the holie Ghoſt,
ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the mouth of the Church.</p>
            <p n="22">22 In theſe kindes of elections, whether they be done at
once in the ſame tenour, time and place, (which vſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the firſt
in a holie ſort practiſed in the Church, was afterwarde made dangerous by
couetouſneſſe and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) or in diuers actions, times and places: it
is meet, as it hath bene the continuall practiſe of all well ordered
chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that firſt the Paſtors, Doctors and Elders, ſhuld haue the
chief dealing, as being thoſe who both haue the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the flocke,
and are likelie to bee of ſounder judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in diſcerning the doctrine.
Next vnto them, the chief and eſpeciall men, both in godlineſſe and
authoritie as the Magiſtrate (if hee be a Chriſtian) are to haue place.
Laſtlie, the conſent of the people is to be had, in ſuch ſort as no man
is to bee admitted vnto anie Eccleſiaſticall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but by the
knowledge and conſent of the whole Church.</p>
            <p n="23">23 Election being lawfullie finiſhed, publiſhed, and
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, impoſition of hands or ordination, that is, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of a man,
as it were, in the poſſeſsion of the holie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, is to be done
of Paſtors, in name of the whole El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip.</p>
            <p n="24">24 The Lord hath ordained theſe callings to continue in his
church, to the end of the world: neither indeed hath the church, or euer
ſhall altogether want the miniſterie of the word, ſeeing faith is by
hearing. Yet we ſee (the ſinns of men enforcing the Lord thereunto, and his
juſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which beginneth at his owne houſe, requiring the ſame)
that it hath often come to paſſe, as it was expreſlie foretolde by the
Spirit of God, that the publick miniſtery was for the moſt part, not in the
handes of carefull Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, <pb n="233" facs="tcp:1885:126"/> but of the moſt
forlorne ſpoilers and waſters of the Church, Antichriſt him ſelfe

LXXIIII.</head>
            <p n="1">1 HAuing ſet downe the true &amp; lawfull Miniſtery of the
Goſpell, which the Sonne of God ordained, and by his Spirit deuided into
their ſeuerall functions: It nowe remaineth, that wee adjoyne the falſe
miniſterie of the ſame, to the ende, that contraries beeing laide one
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an other, may be better manifeſted.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In the true Miniſterie of the Goſpell, there are three
things which diſtinguiſh the ſame from the falſe. The one that the
authority of the callings proceed from the Sonne <pb n="234" facs="tcp:1885:127"/> of God,
as being ordained either immediatlie by himſelfe, or mediatlie by his
Apoſtles. The other is, that the calling be lawfull; that is, ſuch a
calling as is ſquared according to the preſcript lawes of the doctrine and
Diſcipline of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. The third is, the preſcript adminiſtration
of the holy callings. Now all theſe things, wee aduouch to haue bene, by a
litle and a little vtterlie ouerthrowen by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſticall tyrannie, which
with the Apoſtle wee may juſtly call, the myſterie of iniquitie.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And firſt wee affirme, that the callings of the Popiſh
Cleargy, which they expreſſe by that proud title of Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, are in
part altogether falſe; that is, ſuch as haue at the firſt bene inuented
by man, and afterward, became meerly diueliſh and in part counterfeit: that
is, ſuch, as onelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the names of true callings, which they
abolliſhed in deed.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Theſe functions following, we hold to be altogether
falſe, &amp; deſtitute of all true foundation; namely, the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the
Biſhop of Rome ouer al Churches: the Cardinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Patriarkſhip,
Archiepiſcopalſhip, &amp; briefly, that whole Epiſcopall degree of
Lord-Biſhops, ouer their fellowe-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p n="5">5 As to the vſurped power of the Biſhop of Rome ouer
others: yea, &amp; ouer al Churches; the ſame by two manifeſt reaſons
amongſt the reſt is conuinced, not to be Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and therefore to
haue no warrant in Gods word. The one, becauſe the Apoſtles were of equal
authority &amp; power amongſt themſelues, as it appeareth by the
commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt who ſent them, &amp; alſo by the record of the
things which were done by them. The other, becauſe that the Apoſtolicall
function, beeing appointed for the laying of the foundation of the chriſtian
Catholike church; now, that the ſame is laid, and the Apoſtles called into
heauen, is ceaſed here vpon earth, in reſpect of their perſonal
mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie; and in reſpect of the building vppon the foundation which they
laid, the doctrine deliuered by them, preſerued from aboue, and which is to
continue to the worldes end, is ſo ſufficient, that there is no need of any
ſucceſſor of the <pb n="235" facs="tcp:1885:127"/> Apoſtolical authority, eyther
from the planting of new Churches, or for the reſtoring of thoſe that are
already planted.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Cardinals, as it appeareth out of the ſtory of FABIAN
&amp; SILVESTER, thogh corrupt ſtories, were at the firſt no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then
the ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the church of Rome, hauing their names from ſeauen
quarters of the citty, (which alſo they called cardines) wheru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to they were
allotted, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called cardinals, is as it were quarters: and thus
doth their borrowed cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tefeit ſtile yet teſtifie. He furthermore ſeemeth
in the writings of Gregory, to be named a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, who is called a Paſtor
or Curat: neither is any mention of thoſe that are now, in the
ſubſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, in ſo much that they are, and
ought to bee juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the moſt ougly brood of Sathan, begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by
him in theſe latter times, for the defence of that ſtrumpet.</p>
            <p n="7">7 As touching the diſtinctions of Biſhoppes into
Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks, Primates, Metropolitans, and Archbiſhops, (al theſe beeing the
ſame at the firſt) that whole woorke was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s inſtitution, and not Gods
ordinance, as euen IEROM him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe teſtifieth in expreſſe words.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Nowe all theſe at the firſt were names of order &amp;
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and not of anie ſuperioritie or power, when any
Eccleſiaſtical controuerſie did ariſe, or any Paſtors were to be
choſen, both Synods might be orderlie gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; Synodall
decrees put in execution; &amp; alſo, that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions might be done by the
aduiſe of the neighbour chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ratified in a comelie manner, without
confuſion.</p>
            <p n="9">9 This diſtinction of Churches, belonging vnto order, and
not vnto anie preheminence of degree, allowed by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, &amp; confirmed by
the Fathers in the councel of Nice, is not of it ſelfe to bee reprehended:
but yet the miſerable iſſue of it, manifeſted at the length, that (in
two reſpectes) there was not that wiſe regarde by this meanes had of the
Churches, which had beene needfull.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Firſt, in that this Prioritie and Primacie, was tied
vnto certaine rites, whereas the regarde ſhould chieflie haue bene had in
this point, vnto the fitnes of the perſons, <pb n="236" facs="tcp:1885:128"/> and not
vnto the power and populouſnes of Cities; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it ſelfe doth
teach vs, that vices invading the very Paſtors themſelues, doe grow no
where more rife, then in great Cities; and in this point, this one thing is
verie won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, that the Fathers in that diſtribution followed the type of
the Romaine Empire; notwithſtanding, that the holie Ghoſt by IOHN,
ſpeaketh of the image of the beaſt.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The other, in that they made one man ouer-ſeer ouer more
elderſhips or churches then had bin needfull, &amp; that for tearme of life,
(vnles ſome great matter had fallen out, although at that time, he eaſilie
ſuffered himſelfe to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed:) whence the waye was opened firſt,
for thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to opreſſe their fellow-laborers; Next vnto mutual
contention amongeſt themſelues, then to the tyrannicall gouernement of a
few; and laſt, vnto that Antichriſtian ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Whence it appeareth of what great moment it was, that the
gouernement of the Church ordained by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and vnder the which, the
Churches flouriſhed euen in perſecution, (being a gouernment conſiſting
of an Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratie, moſt diuinelie mixed with the holy Democratie of the
Church, vnder that onely Monarch, ruling by his owne lawes,) ſhould haue
beene retained, rather then new degrees and formes of gouernement ſhould haue
bene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and eſpeciallie according vnto the paterne of the Romaine
Empire: wherein they did no other thing, then the Iſraelites in times paſt,
who not contenting themſelues with the Ariſtocratie ordained by the Lord,
would bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by kings, after the manner of the nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Yet the Fathers fore-ſeeing this inconuenience, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored
to preuent the ſame by many decrees, both of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and generall Synods,
leaſt that this order by anie pretence, ſhould be turned into honour and
lordlie domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But what compelled them to ordaine that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they
were neceſſarilie enforced to prouide a remedy?</p>
            <p n="14">14 And alaſſe, this remedie was vſed in vaine, as
moſt woefull experience did preſentlie teſtifie. From whence I 
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1885:128"/> pray you did it proceed, but from this authoritie
attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto certaine Cities and places: that firſt ſciſmes, next,
the defence of hereſies did ariſe, and preſently the chaunge of the

vnto the Romaine Patriarke by reaſon of the dignitie of new Rome: he in the

Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Nowe as touching the other functions; the onelie names
whereof, haue remained amongſt the falſe Romiſh cleargy to blind the

            <p n="16">16 The Lord in his word, hath opened one onely way, whereby

               <head>Concerning Deacons.</head>
               <p n="12">12 It is cleare and out of controuerſie, vnto all thoſe
that are conuerſant in the reading of the word, and in the ſtorie of the
purer Church, that the Deacons, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce of the Apoſtles, had the
charge of the Church-goods, wherein they were alſo ſubject vnto the
ouerſight of the Paſtors. But in the falſe Romiſh Church, wherein they
haue adjoined ſubdeacons vnto their Deacons, what is it I pray you to be a
Deacon? Forſooth, to be diſcerned from the Prieſt ſaying Maſſe, by
a coat without ſleeues, to ſtand anſwering the Prieſt at his right, or
at his left hande, (if the Maſſe be to be chanted or ſung, otherwiſe
Deacons haue nothing to doe there:) when hee ſecretlie muttereth 
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1885:131"/> ſome things to himſelf, to chaunt the Epiſtle, as
they call it, and to reade a peece of the Goſpell: to reach the Cup or
Chalice vnto the Prieſt, being to make merrie therwith alone: brieflie, to
carie about the baſen, wherein they doe receaue the money that is offered by
the poore miſerable ſheep, to bee deuided onelie amongſt the wolues
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And who I pray you do exerciſe this Miniſterie? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen they,
who though they bee ſacrificing Maſſe-prieſtes themſelues, doe yet
for the names ſake, play the part of a Deacon and Sub-deacon in this Comedie.
But what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in the meane time of the goods of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
vnto the poore? Surelie this whole praie (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Hoſpitals, which Cities
and Townes are bound to maintaine vpon their owne charges) beeing ſhared and
torne in peeces amongſt the wolues themſelues, is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licklie, without all
ſhame, beſtowed vpon the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of dogs and horſes, of whoores and
baudes, vpon dycing and carding, and all kinde of luxuriouſneſſe,
vnleſſe it bee that couetouſnes dooth deuoure vp ſome portion of it, or
that it be ſpent vpon the maintenance of Ciuil diſſentions amongſt
themſelues, or vpon the perſecuting of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
               <p>There is therefore, no office of the Deacon according to Gods
ordinaunce, in the falſe counterfait Church of of Rome; no Deacon, but onelie
in name, vnleſſe wee had rather call al theſe forlorne wretches, by the
name of Deacons than of ſacrilegious perſons, as they are in deede.</p>
               <p n="13">13 As to the inferiour orders (as they cal them) they are
not ſo much to bee counted Eccleſiaſticall functions, (whereof we haue
alreadie ſpoken,) as certaine exerciſes, wherby the young me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (excepting
onlie the Exorciſts) that were conſecrated vnto the church were, in times
paſt, made meet, (a proof being had of their godlines and religion) to the
execution of the miniſterial functions, wherof we haue ſpoken.</p>
               <p n="14">14 The office of the Oſtiaries or doore-keepers, was to
atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church-dore, leaſt that any Catechiſt, or any 
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1885:132"/> who making their repentance, ſtood in the
Church-porch; ſhould raſhly intrude themſelues vnto the holy aſſembly
or Supper. Now, the Readers office was, ſtanding at the desk to read ſome
part of the word vnto the people, while they ſtaied for the Sermon. The
Acolythes did attend vppon the Paſtors, and vpon the Biſhop, not onelie for
honours ſake, but alſo for the performance of diuers other ſeruices if it
were needfull: and euen to the end, that the Paſtours ſhould doe nothing,
(as neere as could bee) without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: brieflie, that by this their
dailie attendance and hearing, the young men might be made meet for the holy
functions. As touching Exorciſts, the Chriſtian Church vſed them (as long
as the guift of miracles continued) to the healing of thoſe that were
poſſeſſed and diſtracted, or at leaſt wiſe, for the commending of
them to God, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine peculiar prayers. But ſeeing the guift of miracles,
is now ceaſed, to what purpoſe ſhould wee haue Exorciſts?</p>
               <p n="15">15 Now, becauſe it was ordained by the ancient Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
that no man ſhould be raſhlie admitted vnto the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
functions, who had not firſt approued his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and diligence vnto the
Church, in theſe ſmall offices, therefore do our good Romaniſts, of that
falſe and apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Romiſh Church, before they admit anie vnto the
higheſt orders (as they call them) which are moſt diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ordaine
with moſt fooliſh and ridiculous ceremonies their Clarks hauing paid their
fees, euen in the one &amp; the ſelfe ſame week, to be Dore-keepers,
Readers, Acolythes, and Exorciſts: and within a ſhort while after, they
preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie (if they pay for it) will admit them vnto their higher or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
Now in their churches, they haue neither oſtiary nor reader; and as for
Acolythes, they do not ſo much as know them by name. Touching exorciſm, it
is partly ridiculouſly performed in Baptiſme, by all Curates or Prieſtes
that are their ſubſtitutes, as though that al the children of the
chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were borne poſſeſſed with Deuils: and partly vſed in a
wonderous jugling and deceitfull ſort, by ſome, who are indued (forſooth)
with a peculiar kind of power ouer euil Spirits, (as in times paſt, when as
the gifts of miracles was <pb n="245" facs="tcp:1885:132"/> in force:) and that
ſometimes, as it hath bene ſeene, when they haue ſuborned thoſe, who
faigned them ſelues poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with Deuils: though alſo they haue
ſometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it in deed, by reaſon that the Deuill did not refuſe
to depart out of the bodies of men, as ouer-come by ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the
Croſſe, or ſprinckling of holie water, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the dead, that
thereby deceiuing many a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſoule, hee might confirme them in their
ſuperſtitious worſhip.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in Poperie, there is neither Oſtiarie, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Acolyth, or Exorciſt, ſaue in mockerie and in name onely.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Wherefore alſo, there is in that Babilon, no holie
order or Miniſterie in deed, no lawfull calling, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no true
Apoſtolicall ſucceſsion, but a meere vſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holie

Catholicke Churche, that there hath bene, and that as yet, in ſome ſort
there dooth remaine a true Church held captiue in Babilon, which the Lord
ſome few yeares ſince, began to bring out of the ſaid captiuitie: and it

LXXVI.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>HAVING DONE WITH THE ECCLESIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall functions: it remaineth,
that wee nowe ſhewe what, and how great the power and authoritie thereof is
to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 BVt before we come vnto the particuler handling hereof,
there are two things eſpecially to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: <pb n="246" facs="tcp:1885:133"/>
the one, that this whole power is ſpirituall, that is, directlie belonging
vnto the conſcience; and therefore, that is ſeuered from the power and
authoritie of the Magiſtrate, by the ſubſtauntiall forme and proper ende
thereof: The other, that it is not a ſoueraigne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, neither
conſiſting in their will vnto whome it is committed, but onelie an
Adminiſtratorie powe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, contained within certaine boundes and lawes
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by GOD, the onelie Lorde and Lawe-giuer of his Churche, vppon
whome alone alſo, and not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon men, the force and efficacie therereof dooth
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</p>
            <p>That whole Lordlie power therefore, which both the Biſhoppe of
Rome, and the reſt of the falſe Biſhops haue attributed vnto them
ſelues, togeather with the temporall Gouernement alſo, which they haue
wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and (which is more intollerable,) the rule which they haue
vſurped ouer the conſciences of men, is not a power ordained by God: but a
tyrannie inuented by Sathan and his inſtruments, for the diſturbing of mans
ſocietie, and the ouerthrowe of the true power of the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This true power of the Church, is partlie orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt Sathan, and the reſt of the enemies of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: namelie,
ſinne, the world, and death, which are ſubject vnto him; and it dooth
partlie belong vnto that order and degree, which the Lord hath appointed for
the gouernment of his owne houſe, that is, his Church here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The former of theſe two, is common to the whole Churche,
whereby it commeth to paſſe, that the ſame, leaning vpon the power of
GOD, doth preuaile againſt the gates of Hell: and it is alſo beſtowed
(although not in the ſame meaſure, but as it pleaſeth the holie Ghoſt
to giue it) vppon euerie particular member of the Church: whereby it commeth to
paſſe, that the holy Ghoſt in them dooth tread Sathan vnder feete,
reſiſt the fleſhe, beare rule ouer ſinne: yea, &amp; at the length,
vtterlie deſtroy and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <pb n="247" facs="tcp:1885:133"/> death.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Neere vnto this, is that other extraordinary &amp;
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular force, whereby the Lord indued his, when and whom hee thought good,
with the power of caſting out Diuels in the name of the Lord, and with other
gifts of woorking miracles.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The other, Eccleſiaſticall power, which concerneth the
order appointed for the Gouernement of the Church, is defined to bee that
power, which is giuen vnto them that are in the function of the Miniſterie,
ouer thoſe whoſe ſaluation they are, in reſpect of their calling, to
promote; of this ſort, are Paſtors and Elders called alſo Gouernors, of
whome wee haue ſpoken in the former ſort of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p n="6">6 This whole power conſiſteth in three points; namelie, in
teaching, in appointing of lawes, and in cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The right and authoritie of teaching, not what they thincke
good, but that onelie which the Lorde hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Prophets and
Apoſtles, and in the publicke adminiſtration of thoſe Sacraments, which,
and in thoſe rites wherein, hee commaunded them to be adminiſtred, dooth
belong onelye vnto thoſe Paſtours that are rightlie called, as long as the
ordinarie vocation dooth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Now this authoritie, euerie faithfull Paſtor is bound to
practiſe: not onelie vniuerſallie amongeſt his flocke, but euen towardes
euerie particular ſheepe thereof, by inſtructing, comforting, and
correcting them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as their neceſsitie requireth: as the Lord in
EZECHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ELL, and the Apoſtle himſelfe, by his owne example dooth teach vs.
Act. 20.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The ſtrength and efficacie of this power is ſhewed, in
that it is Metaphorically expreſſed by the names of Keyes, of ſhutting
and opening: and properlie vttered by remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and retaining of ſinnes,
and it is alſo of that great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that that is ſaied to bee looſed
and remitted: and on the other-ſide, to bee ſhutte and retained in Heauen, 
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1885:134"/> which is opened and remitted, and in like ſort ſhut
and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in earth.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Yet is not that by this meanes transferred to men, which
is onely proper vnto God, and to our ſauiour Chriſt Ieſus, vnto whome
alone all judgement is committed: but heereby is ment, that that is ratified
with GOD, which is rightly done in his name by his Paſtor, that is choſen
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, or rather that God is the authour of that which hee doth by his
Miniſters, declaring remiſsion of ſinnes, vnto thoſe that beleeue the
Goſpell, and condemnation vnto the vnbeleeuers, according vnto that ſaying:
[Hee that heareth you, heareth me: hee that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth
me, he that beleeueth ſhalbe ſaued; hee that beleeueth not, is alreadie
condemned.]</p>
            <p>The Romiſh Prelate therefore, and his falſe Cleargie, who doe
falſlie beare the world in hand, that the keies and power of opening and
ſhutting of heauen is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto them, do abuſe their Miniſterie,
and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the ſaying of Chriſt, (let them alone) they are blind
leaders of the blind.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The other part of this Eccleſiaſticall gouernment,
being committed to Paſtors and Elders, which wee ſaid to conſiſt in
appointing of lawes, is ſo to be vnderſtood, not as though it were lawfull
in Chriſtian Religion, to impoſe lawes vpon the conſciences, as it is in
the Ciuill pollicie, to ordaine and to abrogate ciuill lawes and
conſtitutions; the which point, the Apoſtle expreſlie teſtifieth, not
to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto the very Angels. For we haue but one law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, namely,
the onely Sonne, being the alone interpretour of his Fathers will, and the head
of the Church, who hath moſt fully opened the whole counſell of our
ſaluation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the whole worſhippe due vnto him, and hath both
by his own mouth, and alſo by the Apoſtles, both by preaching and by
writing, moſt perfectly ſet down the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of his owne houſe, euen
vnto the ende of the world, wherevnto nothing is to bee added or detracted, and
wherein it is vnlawfull to change one tittle.</p>
            <p n="12">12 That matter therefore, remaining whole and ſound 
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1885:134"/> in thoſe points, which God hath commanded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his worſhippe, and the duties of a Chriſtian life: it followeth, that the
Church hath power to enact lawes, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie touching thoſe thinges which belong
vnto comelines and order, and appertaine vnto the mutuall agreement of the
faithfull, in the outwarde worſhip of God; in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which
matters, ſeeing by reaſon of the diuers and ſometimes repugnant
circumſtances, (the Church beeing now gathered out of all nations,) they
cannot bee the one and the ſame at all times and places: It followeth, that
it is free and lawfull, either to ordaine or to abrogate them, as it ſhall
appeare, that the neceſsitie or commodity of the Church doth require the
ſame.</p>
            <p n="13">13 But heere ſome thinges are eſpecially to bee verie
carefullie taken heede vnto: Firſt, that the conſcience bee not enſnared
hereby, as though theſe lawes were anie part of Gods worſhip. For the Lorde
doth condemne all will-worſhip, as being himſelfe the onlie Law-giuer of
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Secondly, that vnprofitable, curious, and ridiculous
rites, be not appointed in ſtead of graue, comely, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable order.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Thirdly, that the true and pure worſhip of God, bee not
hindred, much leſſe oppreſſed by the multitude of ſuch lawes.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Fourthly, that eſpecial care be had, that theſe things
by a falſe pretence of Religion, grow not into ſuperſtition: much more,
that they degenerate not into impietie: and if this come to paſſe, that
they be either preſently amended, or rather vtterly abolliſhed.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Now that men haue long ſince greatly offended in theſe
matters, experience alaſſe, and the lamentable defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the church,
doth make it true and manifeſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the true vſe both of the word,
&amp; alſo of the Sacraments, hath bene not onely depraued, but euen turned
into open Idolatrie.</p>
            <p>All the will-worſhip then, that hath beene brought, either into
the Weſt by that Romiſh Prelat, and his falſe <pb n="250" facs="tcp:1885:135"/>
Biſhops, or into the Eaſt Churches, by the Patriarkes of Greece: we doe at
once condemne.</p>
            <p>And we affirme, that thoſe Chriſtian Magiſtrats haue doone
well, who by the procurement and aduiſe, of the true ſeruants of God, haue
cut off out of their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, many vnprofitable ceremonies, (and altogether
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolliſhed the vngodly and ſuperſtitious rites) how anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſo euer
they were.</p>
            <p>We doe on the contrary ſide auouch, that they haue ſmally
regarded the good of the Churches within their dominions, who either haue
retained the relicks of ſuch ceremonies, or haue choſen in a kinde of
prepoſterous judgement, rather to correct them, then at once to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
them.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Briefly, the ordinary and lawful power, to ordain and
abrogate theſe lawes, doth neither depend onelie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the will and good
liking of the Paſtour alone, nor yet vpon the judgement of ſome Presbitery
onely; but there is alſo required, that heerevnto be adjoyned the conſent
and authoritie of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, togeather with the approbation
and allowance of the flocke: who are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, raſhly to diſſent from
the judgement of their Paſtors and Elders, beeing grounded vpon juſt
reaſons, which are agreeable vnto Gods word, that all things may be orderly
done in the houſe of God.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Now although theſe lawes are not impoſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
conſcience, yet being once eſtabliſhed, no man can with a good
conſcience violate them, both by reaſon of offence, and alſo of the
contumacie that ſhould ariſe thereof.</p>
            <p>We doe therefore condemne, all the open tyranny of the Papiſts,
euen in this point alſo.</p>
            <p>Now, touching the third part of Eccleſiaſtical juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which we ſaid to conſiſt in the lawful and judicial chaſtiſing of
offenders: we will deale God-willing, with that point in the Principles

part thereof, which conſiſteth in Iudiciall cenſuring.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 THe Church of God in this life, is ſubject vnto ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
Domeſticall offences; the which, though they cannot be vtterlie taken away,
before that laſt day; yet are they to bee carefully fore-ſeene, that as
neere as may be, they doe not ariſe; and when they doe ariſe, that they may
be purged by the holy Miniſterie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Of this purgeing, there hath beene alwaies an order, and a
practiſe appointed in the Church by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, whereby, not
onelie the Church in generall, hath bin ſeuered from thoſe who are
manifeſtly prophane, as in times paſt before the law, the ſonnes of God
were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from the ſonnes of men; but alſo thoſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued
themſelues amiſſe in the boſom of the Church, were ſeperated from the
ſincere worſhippers of the true God; in which ſenſe, the ancients
thought rightlie, that CAIN was ſaid to be expelled from the face of the
Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This order, as alſo all other the parts of
Eccleſiaſtical gouernment, was more diſtinctlie and manifeſtly ordained
by God vnder the lawe, where were ordained diuers rites, both of inwarde and
outwarde pollutions, and alſo of the manner of their cleanſing and
purifiyng; which rites were preſcribed vnto the Elderſhip of the
Synagogue.</p>
            <p n="4">4 This order beeing appointed by the Lord, although the rules
of the Synagogue did moſt impudentlie and <pb n="252" facs="tcp:1885:136"/> wickedly
abuſe the ſame, euen againſt Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: yet did
Chriſt teach, as MATHEVVE witneſſeth, that this ſame was to be
appointed in the chriſtian church retaining euen the verie name of Elders to
this purpoſe, the which thing the Apoſtles performed, and obſerued ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
diligently, as it appeareth by the expreſſe teſtimonies and examples of
their writings.</p>
            <p n="5">5 This alſo is manifeſt, out of the whole
Eccleſiaſticall ſtorie, that the Chriſtian Church euen vnto this day,
neuer wanted this order; although that the Elders properly and peculiarlie ſo
called, (of whome we haue ſpoken at large in the former Principles,) were by
a little and a litle abolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the tyranie of the falſe Biſhops; in
the place wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, came thoſe moſt prophane Courts of their Officials, as
they call them, and that abhominable gouernment of the Antichriſtian
kingdome.</p>
            <p n="6">6 What, and how great that Babilonicall confuſion is, it may
appeare no way better, then by the comparing of it with the true ordinaunce of
God. Now this true ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce conſiſteth of two partes eſpeciallie:
Firſt, that the adminiſtration of it, ſhould be committed vnto thoſe
one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wherevnto the word of God doth allot the ſame: next, that they vnto
whome this care is committed, doe holilie and ſincerelie exerciſe this
power.</p>
            <p n="7">7 That this ſpirituall juriſdiction is committed vnto the
Paſtours and the Elders (peculiarlie ſo called) beeing rightlie choſen,
wee haue fullie ſhewed in the former prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>That whole authoritie then, which the Biſhops, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Poperie and
the Romaine Antichriſt himſelfe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the inſtruments of his
tyrannie do vſurpe, is altogeather tyrannous. Neither ought the power of
exerciſing this Eccleſiaſticall cenſure either of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or
leſſer Excommunication, (as they cal them) to be in the hand of ſome one

            <p>They are alſo deceaued, who on the contrarie ſide do hold that
this juriſdiction ought to be exerciſed by the <pb n="253" facs="tcp:1885:136"/> whole
aſſemblie of the Church, the which they gather vpon the wrong expoſition
of the places, MATH. 18.17. 1. COR. 5.4.</p>
            <p n="8">8 This cenſure is rightlie adminiſtred, when as thoſe
are called, who ought to be called, and both parties being pacientlie heard
togeather with conuenient witneſſes, if the caſe ſo require, the whole
controuerſie is decided in the feare of God, without prejudice or declining
vnto ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, as the Apoſtle teacheth.</p>
            <p n="9">9 We affirme that thoſe who are to be called, ought to be

            <p n="10">10 Thoſe that are altogether without (ſuch as are at this

            <p n="11">11 The ſame is to be held touching Shiſmatickes, and
Haeretickes; which by their manifeſt departure, haue made as it were, an
other bodie of the Church, or haue beene borne in thoſe ſects, hauing neuer
joined themſelues vnto the true Church: of which ſort are the
Anabaptiſts, newe-Arrians, Libertines, and the reſt of ſuch ſectaries,
which are to bee altogether accounted for thoſe which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: but are
yet either by Synods, priuate diſputations, &amp; conferences, or by anie
other meanes, if they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues tractable, to be called into the

            <p n="12">12 But wee are to thinke otherwiſe of priuat perſons, who
continue as yet within the boſome of the Church, &amp; haue made no

bee called, to be admoniſhed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, and if they bee obſtinat, and
ſuch as are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of their owne conſcience, to be deliuered vnto
Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it is manifeſt out of the writings, and by the examples of the

            <p>Excommunication therefore, of Graſhoppers or Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts, of

            <p n="13">13 As touching thoſe that haue priuatlie ſinned, and haue
not giuen publick offence, our Sauiour Chriſt dooth teach moſt plainelie
MATH. 18. how they are to bee dealt with. Now publick offenders are either to
bee preſentlie reprehended, if the occaſion ſo require, euen to their
faces as PAVLE practiſed towards PETER, 1. TIMOTH. 5.20. or to bee reproued
in the publick aſſemblie of the Elderſhip, as the very ſame Apoſtle
teacheth vs.</p>
            <p n="14">14 That a difference is to be made betweene outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

            <p n="15">15 Vnbrideled contumacie, is almoſt the moſt hainous
ſinne againſt the Church: whether it bee that hee who is called, refuſeth
to appeare, or that beeing lawfullie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed and conuicted, he denie to
confeſſe his fault as it deſerueth.</p>
            <p n="16">16 After the lawfull triall of the cauſe, both the whole
fact togeather with the circumſtances, are carefullie to bee conſidered:
and alſo great regarde is to bee had of the ſinner himſelfe: brieflie,
all things are to bee referred vnto this end: namelie, that regard be had both
to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the ſinner, and alſo to the aedification of the

            <p n="17">17 For the end of theſe Cenſures, is of two ſorts: the
one, that a timelie and a conuenient remedie may bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſinner,
who is neither to bee left in his ſinne, nor ſwallowed vp with
heauineſſe. The other ende is, both that the Church may bee purged from

inſtructed and taught by the example of others.</p>
            <p n="18">18 There is alſo a difference to bee made, betweene thoſe

ſhould not bee had for the publick aedification of the Church, as the

declare. Touching which point, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall rule, neither can nor ought to bee
ſet downe, by reaſon of the varietie and diuerſitie of the
circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, (with reuerence of the Fathers bee it ſpoken) wee doe
not allowe of the too great ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of manie of the auncient Cannons, in
appointing the ſpace of repentance, from the which neceſsitie compelled
them to depart by bringing in their indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</p>
            <p n="19">19 The ſortes of theſe Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures,
are Admonition, Suſpenſion from the Supper of the Lord, (which they call
the leſſer Excommunication) publick Excommunication, vnto the time that
repentance bee teſtified: as it is manifeſt that the Hebrewes alſo had a
three-folde Excommunication. Yet as touching perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ANATHEMA, or
Excommunication to death: the Fathers of the ſoundeſt judgement juſtlie
diſliked the ſame.</p>
            <p n="20">20 We are to abſtain from the companie of thoſe that are
publicklie excommunicated, to the end (as the Apoſtle witneſſeth) that
they may be aſhamed: yet ſo, as we are to performe towards them, all
thoſe things which appertain to admoniſh them of their dutie, and to call
them to the right way.</p>
            <p n="21">21 This Excommunication is altogeather a ſpirituall
chaſtiſment, and dooth directlie belong vnto the amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
conſcience.</p>
            <p>Wherefore they are ouerthrowne both by the word of God, &amp; by the
teſtimonies of the whole Eccleſiaſtical ſtorie, who do attribute the
authoritie of the Elderſhip, in binding and looſing, vnto the Magiſtrate,
though Chriſtian: much more they who leaue no place, vnto thoſe
Eccleſiaſticall judgements, where there is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian 
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:1885:138"/> Magiſtrate; ſeeing on the contrarie ſide, they can
be no where more practiſed, than vnder his wings, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as his authoritie,
(who is the maintainer and defender of this whole diuine ordinaunce) is vſed
againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient: neither was there anie other courſe taken in
the auncient Church, euen vnder the moſt religious Emperours.</p>
            <p>They doe alſo greeuouſlie erre, who (as it is vſuall
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Papiſts) drawe meere Ciuill cauſes vnto this
Eccleſiaſticall Court. For Chriſt did not onelie diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, but
alſo moſt manifeſtlie ſeuer the office of the Magiſtrat, from the
eccleſiaſtical functions: although he hath commanded all thoſe, who
execute the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call functions, aſwel as al the reſt of the
ſubjects, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them ſelues vnto the power of the Magiſtrates, in
thoſe thinges which are properlie belonging to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And againe, hee
will haue Kings and Emperours themſelues, to be ſubject vnto the authoritie
of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Miniſterie, and to the commandement of his word.
Nowe, of this diuine order, wee do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Magiſtrats are
ordained the maintainers and defenders.</p>
            <p n="22">22 The contract of Mariage, ſeeing in part it is

bond and couenaunt of the mariage: and in part meerelie Ciuill, as far as it
belongeth vnto the common ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eietie of men: &amp; in that diuers ciuil
conditions belonging to the things of this life, are adjoyned thervnto:
wherefore Matrimonial controuerſies, are in ſome ſort to be referred vnto
the determination of the Elderſhip, as ſhall bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more fullie (God

            <p n="23">23 They who haue authoritie to binde the ſinner, the
cauſe beeing lawfullie tried; haue alſo authoritie to looſe and to
reſtore him to the Church, when hee hath approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his repentance.</p>
            <p n="24">24 This confeſsion, that is, this profeſsion of

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1885:138"/> in the congregation of the Church, is to go before his
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and reconciliation with the church; in ſuch ſort, as the
neglecting hereof is to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vndoubted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacie.</p>
            <p>They are therefore deceaued, who thinke that thoſe who are bound
in the Conſiſtorie of the Elderſhip, are to be left vnto their owne
judgement and triall.</p>
            <p>And they offend no leſſe, who as they haue aboliſhed the
Elderſhip, ſo alſo haue they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded this confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (which is
onelie proper vnto thoſe that are tied by the judgement of the Elderſhip)
as a law, common to al Chriſtians, and haue turned it vnto auricular
confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is to bee done eyther vnto the Maſſe-prieſt, or vnto
the Confeſſor as they commonlie call him.</p>
            <p n="25">25 Seeing this confeſsion (though moſt acceptable vnto
God,) is not therefore ordained, that it ſhould bee a ſatisfaction for
ſinne in the preſence of God, but onelie that the Church may be aſſured
of the repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of the ſinner, it is onelie thus farre
neceſſarie, as he who hath not performed the ſame before his death, (the
fault not beeing his) is yet juſtlie accounted as abſolued, if he hath
repented in his hart.</p>
            <p>Deteſtable therefore is their opinion, who will haue the

ſatisfactory in the preſence of God; and vnder that pretence, haue (for the
moſt part) made that purgatorie fire of theirs, and brought into the Church,
their Indulgences which they ſell for money, being ſo manie blaſphemies
againſt that one oblation of the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p n="26">26 The Elderſhip dooth properlie neither binde nor looſe,
for this is the proper right of Chriſt alone: but it doth onelie apply the
word of God, after the lawfull triall of the cauſe, vnto the ſinner; either
for his retaining or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing vpon earth: and it pronounceth vpon earth, in
the name of God and of Ieſus Chriſt, that either contumacie had bound, or
repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce had looſed the conſcience of the ſinner before the Lord in
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: neither is it to be doubted <pb n="258" facs="tcp:1885:139"/> but that which is
thus done vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, is ratified in heauen</p>
            <p>Friuolous therefore is that objection of ſome, who to the end they
might aboliſh the authority of the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, doe pretend that men
arrogate vnto themſelues the authoritie of God and Chriſt, in retaining or
remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Hence alſo it followeth, that thoſe Eccleſiaſtical
cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are of no force, which are exerciſed by thoſe who were not
appointed by God to be judges in that cauſe, and wherein, either the lawfull
triall of the cauſe hath not gone before, or the ſentence hath exceeded
thoſe bounds within the which, God will haue the authority of the Elderſhip
to be contained; much more are their cenſures of no effect, who vnder the
falſe pretence of Gods name, do judge contrarie vnto his word.</p>
            <p n="27">27 This manner of confeſsion either before the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
or Presbyterie, is ſo far from procuring any diſcredite with men, vnto the

vnto that dignity and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie amongſt Chriſtians, whereunto they are
promoted who are made the ſonnes of God.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1 SEing Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, doth according to
the word of God alone take order with offences; and that there are manie
ſtubborne and obſtinat perſons to be found, who cannot be drawne vnto the
way, by anie admonitions or cenſures of the Church, either in regarde 
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1885:139"/> of pietie, or yet of common quietnes: an other remedy
was to be prouided, whereby this vntamed &amp; brutiſh vnrulines of men,
might be healed.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This remedie is in their hands, vnto whome a kinde of
ſupreame power hath euer ſince the beginning of the world, bene aſcribed:
and in whoſe power the ſoueraigne gouernment hath bene alwaies in making of
thoſe lawes, wherby the ciuill ſocietie of men ſhould be maintained.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is manifeſt by the common conſent of men, (who haue
rightlie judged that good lawes and their maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and defenders, haue bene
the worke of Gods Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) that this Ciuill power was not iuſtituted by
men, for the hurt of man; but ordained by God for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of
mankind, in ſuch ſort, as the Lord doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe Magiſtrats to be
called ELOHIM, that is, Gods.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Of theſe formes of gouernments, there are reckoned vp
three ſorts eſpeciallie: a Monarchie, which is the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of one
aboue the reſt: an Ariſtocracie, where many of the nobilitie &amp; beſt
ſort haue the gouernment in their hands: and a Democratie, where the ſame
conſiſteth in the power of the whole people.</p>
            <p>The Anabaptiſts therefore are to be deteſted, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
al gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; ſpeake euil of the ſuperior powers vnder the pretence
of a kinde of imaginarie perfection, which ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not in need of the
gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Their cauill is alſo friuolous, wherby they goe about
to proue, that we can haue no vſe of the Magiſtracy, becaus we acknowledge
Ieſus Chriſt for our Lord and King, by whoſe ſpirit we are led: wheras
the inward power which the Lorde exerciſeth by the vertue of his Spirite in
the conſciences of his children, doth not onlie exclude that outward dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which belongeth vnto the Magiſtrate as vnto Gods Liuetenaunt, but doth
eſtabliſh the ſame.</p>
            <p n="5">5 We affirme that the dutie of the Magiſtrate dooth extend
it ſelf vnto both the Tables of Gods law, or as the Apoſtle ſaieth, that
it is their dutie to prouide that their ſubjects may not onlie liue
peaceablie, but alſo religiouſly, But in a diuers reſpect and manner.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:1885:140"/>6 For in reſpect of the firſt Table,
it is vnlawfull for the Magiſtrates to inuent anie lawes touching Religion:
but their dutie is to ſee that the worſhip of God, be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and
practiſed by their ſubjects; as it is fullie ſet down in the ſacred
bookes of both the Teſtaments, which haue bene written by the Apoſtles,
Prophetes, and Euangeliſts.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The Magiſtrates alſo are bound (if neceſsitie ſo
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) to compel ſuch as are in the Eccleſiaſtical function, vnto the
godlie and carefull performance of their dutie: &amp; they are much more bound
to puniſh blaſphemers, and ſuch as either broach haereſies, make a
departure from the Church by ſchiſmes, or brieflie doe anie wiſe endeuour
to ouerthrow the truth of the Goſpell: together with thoſe, who will not
ſuffer themſelues to be called into the right way, by the Cenſures of the
Church.</p>
            <p n="8">8 And if anie controuerſie doe ariſe concerning the truth
of doctrine, vnto the appeaſing wherof, an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie meeting of the
Paſtors &amp; the Doctors of the Church ſeemeth needfull: It is the dutie
of the Magiſtrate to call a Synode, to gather the Miniſters together
thereunto, and to ſee that the whole controuerſie bee decided according to
the holie Scriptures: and being decided, that it bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed and
vtterlie put out.</p>
            <p>The Pope therefore dooth thruſt his ſickle vnto other mens
corne, who doth licentiouſlie arrogate vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, this power of
ſummoning Councels at his owne pleaſure, which was in times paſt
juſtlie exerciſed by the godlie Emperours and Kings.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Now, touching the ſecond Table; the Magiſtrates are to
ſee, that by their juſt lawes, they be the protectours and defenders of
publick innocencie, modeſty and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie, that they maintaine the good
from the injuries of the euill men, and vphold by their help and power ſuch
as are oppreſſed: brieflie that they haue a regard of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon goods of
all their ſubjects.</p>
            <p n="10">10 This ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be performed by them, except they be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with power &amp; might: wherfore they are to be armed with the ſword, to the
end that they ſuffer not thoſe ſins to <pb n="261" facs="tcp:1885:140"/> remaine
vnpuniſhed; which God, and the behoofe of the Common-wealth require to be
puniſhed.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Hence alſo wee vnderſtand, that when neceſsitie ſo
compelleth them, and when they cannot otherwiſe defend the Dominions
committed vnto their gouernement, they may lawfullie proclaime warre, both that
they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by keepe vnder the ſeditious practiſes of the vnbrideled
Domeſticall diſturbers of the common peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and deliuer their
Dominions from the inuaſions, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other the attempts of their forraine
enemies.</p>
            <p n="12">12 For the vpholding of this burthen, they may lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
require tributes and ſubſidies of the people, whome they gouerne: The
annuall reuenues furthermore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Magiſtrates doe maintaine the
honour, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of their daily port and traine (beeing thinges in
ſome ſort joyned with the dignitie of the Gouernement, which they beare)
are to be paied vnto them.</p>
            <p n="13">13 It is their dutie alſo, to publiſh the lawes and
edicts which ſeeme neceſſarie for the right gouernment of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

            <p n="14">14 No vncha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geable rule of theſe laws, by reaſon of the
varietie of circumſtances can be ſet downe, ſaue onely this one; namely,
that they be leaueled and directed vnto Gods glorie, and to the good of the
ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Wee doe therefore condemne thoſe cuſtomes, lawes, and
conſtitutions, which decline from this aeternall rule of the honour of God,
and loue towards our neighbor, and do permit, either theft, ſtewes, or any

con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, as vnto whome no obedience is to bee yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Yet we hold it not in any caſe lawful, for priuat men to

            <p n="16">16 It becommeth Chriſtians, leaſt of all other men to be

void of al guile, reuenge and euill affection.</p>
            <p>They are deceiued therefore, who thinke it vnlawfull, that

            <p n="17">17 All men, of what age, nation, ſexe, or condition ſo
euer they be, are bound without exception, to be ſubjects vnto this ordinance
of man; not onely for feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the lawe doth inflict, but
euen for conſcience ſake, as the Apoſtle ſaith, who commaundeth vs to
make praier for all Magiſtrates without exception.</p>
            <p>Rebellious and ſeditious therefore, is the Papiſticall Cleargie,
who vnder the colour of certaine counterfeit immunities, hath preſumed to
with-drawe the necke from the yoke of the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Yet is it the duetie of the ſuperiour powers, (of which

            <p n="19">19 As often as the Magiſtrate commandeth any thing, that is
repugnant either to the worſhip which wee owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, or to the loue which

            <head>PRINCIPLES TOVCHING THE RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MISSION OF SINNES, AND THE SIN AGAINST
THE HOLY GHOST. LXXIX.</head>
            <p n="1">1 THe Article concerning the Church is already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entreated
of: it followeth nowe, that wee deale with thoſe benefites which our
heauenlie Father doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon his children, partly in this life, and
partly in the life to come; which are remiſsion of ſinnes, reſurrection
of the bodie, and life euerlaſting.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Article touching the remiſsion of ſinnes, beeing
already ſpoken of, (when as we dealt with the juſtification of man by
Chriſt, &amp; opened the firſt Petition of the Lords Praier:) we wil now
briefly touch the ſame, and then come to that irremiſsible or vnpardonable
ſin, which is called the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Sinne in generall, we define to bee a tranſgreſsion or
ſwaruing from the law, repugnant vnto Gods wil, brought into the world by our
firſt Parents through the inſtigation of Sathan, the fruit whereof is by
the juſt curſe of God, the miſerie of the life preſent, and death
aeternall.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Nowe remiſsion of ſinnes, is the free, and the moſt
full pardon of all our ſinnes, obtained by Chriſt, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by faith,
in the place of which ſins, ſucceedeth the imputation of the righteouſnes
of the ſaid Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The fountaine of the remiſsion of our ſins is, the
ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and conſtant loue of God towards his Church. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, becauſe
he loued vs from aeternity; for if he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to loue vs, hee ſhould haue
bene ſubject vnto change: conſtant, becauſe with God is no ſhadow of
change.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Hence it appeareth, that remiſsion of ſinnes beeing once
beſtowed, can neuer be diſſanulled: For it muſt needs be, that the
counſel of God touching the ſaluation of his, ſhould be ſtable and
firme.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The cauſe whereby, and for the which, we obtaine
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of ſins is, the loue of God towardes man in Chriſt, 
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1885:142"/> who draweth vs from condemnation, deliuereth vs from the
power of darknes, and maketh vs meet to obtaine the inheritance of the Saints
in light.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The inſtrumentall cauſe is faith, wrought in vs by the
hearing of the worde Preached, and confirmed by the vſe of the Sacraments:
whereby we now doe not onely know, that Chriſt is our Sauiour, but alſo doe
applie him and all his riches, which are indeffinitely offered vnto the church,
as ours, and euerie one of vs in particuler are aſſured of our
Election.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The faith therefore of the remiſsion of our ſinnes, is a
moſt full and ſure perſwaſion, whereby, euerie faithfull man dooth
aſſuredlie beleeue, that God the Father, hath pardoned him all his ſins,
for the onely ſacrifice of Chriſt, and in their ſteed, doth impute vnto
him the righteouſnes of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It appeareth out of the former things, that the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning
the remiſsion of the fault, but not of the puniſhment, is altogether moſt
deteſtable: from whence the doctrine, touching meritorious ſatisfaction in
the preſence of God, touching indulgences, Purgatory, and praier for the dead
haue ariſen.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Seeing God, who is offended with ſinne, is juſt: it
followeth, that whoſoeuer doth not that which the Lawe commandeth: and
whoſoeuer dooth that which the Lawe requireth not, maketh himſelfe
ſubject vnto the burthen of Gods wrath: whence it appeareth, that the verie
leaſt tranſgreſsion of the Lawe deſerueth death, if yee conſider the
nature of ſinne. Yet no ſinne is ſo hainous, but it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable in
Chriſt, that one ſinne excepted, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather vncurable and
irremiſsable, whereof wee are now to ſpeake, ſeing we haue already dealt
with remiſsible ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="11">11 This vncurable ſinne, is called ſinne vnto death,
blaſphemie againſt the holy Ghoſt; not ſimply in reſpect that the
holie Ghoſt is the third perſon in the Trinitie, but in regard that it is
hee onelie, who enlightneth the mindes of men, and openeth the way of
ſaluation.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:1885:142"/>12 The ſinne againſt the holie
Ghoſt, is the voluntarie deniall of Chriſt beeing truelie knowen, the
falling away from the Goſpell, being ſealed in the heart of man by the
holie Ghoſt enlightning the ſame, ariſing from the hatred of the truth,
joyned with a ſauadge and more then barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tyrannie againſt the ſame,
and the Sophiſticall opug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therefore, and alſo, with the contempt of
the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, which is the alone propitiation for ſinne.</p>
            <p n="13">13 This ſeemeth to be the manifeſt diſcription of this
horrible ſinne; the cauſe thereof, is the minde and will of man opugning
the knowen truth, by a Sathanicall kind of pride and cruelty.</p>
            <p n="14">14 This ſinne would the Lord therefore haue juſtlie to be
vnpardonable, becauſe that they, who do after this ſort throw themſelues
hedlong, do tread vnder foot the blood of Chriſt, whome they haue trulie
knowen; without whom there is no ſaluation, and doe ſtop vp the way vnto
the gift of repentance.</p>
            <p n="15">15 PAVLE therefore did not ſinne againſt the holie
Ghoſt, who perſecuted Chriſt and his members whome he knew not. 1. TIM.
1.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Although this ſinne bee voluntary, yet it followeth not,
that euery ſinne which is voluntarie, and committed againſt the
conſcience is irremiſsible.</p>
            <p n="17">17 But contrariwiſe, although theſe ſins are horrible,
whether they be committed of infirmitie or of malice, yet are they forgiuen
vnto thoſe that repent, as they were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to DAVID, PETER and others.</p>
            <p n="18">18 The counſel of God concerning the ſaluation of the
elect cannot be diſſanulled, and therefore the elect cannot be guilty of
this ſinne.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Neither doe all the reprobate neceſſarie fall vnto
this ſin, ſeeing originall ſin is ſufficient to condemne them.</p>
            <p n="20">20 This ſinne is placed in the heart of man, and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing God is the ſearcher of the heart, diligent heed is to
bee taken, leaſt that being carried away with a prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous zeale, we
raſhly paſſe ſentence againſt any in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be guilty of
this ſinne.</p>
            <p n="21">
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:1885:143"/>21 Yet are they to be ſeriouſlie
admoniſhed, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſhewe themſelues diſobedient vnto the

            <head>PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE RESVRRECTION OF THE FLESH. LXXX.</head>
            <p n="1">1 THe reſt of the Articles of our faith, being hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſufficientlie handled; two of them remaine yet to bee diſcuſſed,
namely, the reſurrection of the fleſh, and life euerlaſting.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Although the Sonne of God, by taking vpon him our nature, by
dying and riſing againe, hath performed the parts of our ſaluation:
Although alſo he doth beſtow that quickning Spirite of his, vpon all
thoſe that trulie beleeue the Goſpell: It remaineth as yet,
notwithſtanding, that what hath bene performed in him who is our head, be
alſo performed in vs being his members.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Hence muſt the faithfull learne, both day and night to
meditate vpon the marke, and ſhutting vp of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and to bee
continuallie deſirous of the ſame, in ſuch ſort; as although they bee
toſſed in this worlde by diuers and daungerous ſtormes of temptation,
raiſed vp againſt them by the Deuill, the Worlde, and the Fleſhe, they
may yet continue firme and immooue-able in faith, and in the hope of the liuing
GOD, and of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Euen as death entred into the world, by the ſinne of the
firſt ADAM, whence the neceſsitie of death did ariſe: Euen ſo wee
affirme, that death is abolliſhed in the ſaints, and chaunged vnto
aeternall life, by the vertue of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ADAM, that is Chriſt; to the
end, that as Chriſt did <pb n="267" facs="tcp:1885:143"/> firſt of all riſe againe
vnto that aeternall life: So all the elect may riſe by him vnto the
ſame.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Now death is by a naturall generation, conuaied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all
the poſteritie of the firſt ADAM, whereas aeternall life is by ſpirituall
ingraffing into the ſecond ADAM, deriued vnto his members.</p>
            <p n="6">6 In this reſpect, is the name of ADAM attributed vnto
Chriſt; namely, that as ADAM was the ſtocke of mankinde, breathing out
poiſon according vnto the deadlie nature: So Chriſt is made by grace the
root of all the Saints, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the juice of eternall life into his
members.</p>
            <p>Wee doe therefore condemne the Philoſophers, who drewe the cauſe
of death, not from ſinne, but from this Aixome in naturall Philoſophie, vz.
whatſoeuer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, is ſubject vnto diſſolution. Much more doe
wee deteſt the PELAGIANS, who teach, that ſinne and therefore death did
ariſe, not from the deprauati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature in ADAM, but from the voluntarie
imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof: the which errour, PAVLE dooth ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe, as by manie
Argumentes, ſo by this moſt clearelie, in that Infants themſelues alſo
are ſubject vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Although that all ſinnes, which are the cauſe of death,
are truly remitted vnto the beleeuers; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are they no
leſſe ſubject vnto death, then the very wicked themſelues, and that for
two cauſes: Firſt, becauſe that the roote of ſinne, (which is called
originall ſinne) is not vtterlie abolliſhed in them in this life, but is
brought to an end by death. For then doth the ſtrife betweene the fleſh and
the Spirite ceaſe. Secondly, becauſe that vnleſſe they did ſhake of
this life, they could neuer be partaker of that other life which they hope
for.</p>
            <p n="8">8 And therefore we holde, that the faithfull are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of
this life, rather by the mercie of God, calling them vnto that aeternall
kingdom, then becauſe that death is the reward of ſinne.</p>
            <p n="9">9 And on the other ſide, that the vnfaithful do not riſe
by vertue of the reſurrection of Chriſt, which is alwaies 
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1885:144"/> vnto ſaluation and is beſtowed vpon his members, but
by the force of that curſe of God: whenſoeuer thou ſhalt eat of the fruit
hereof, thou ſhalt die the death.</p>
            <p n="10">10 For ſeeing this degree doth comprehend both the deathes,
but eſpecially the ſecond, which is eternall; it muſt needes be, that the
vnfaithfull alſo ſhall riſe againe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwiſe, their bodies
except they ſhould bee joyned again with their ſoules, ſhould eſcape
eternal paines, which is ment by the ſecond death.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The whole perſon of euery man wholie conſidered, but
not in part, is ſaid to riſe again. For as the body only is ſaid to lie
down, ſo the ſame alone (to ſpeak properly) ſhall riſe againe.
Whereas the ſoule (ſeeing by death it hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no detriment in the
eſſence thereof) can bee ſayd to riſe again but metaphorically, as when
it is brought by the Spirite of Chriſt, from the ſeruitude of ſinne
wherein it was dead, and wherein it could not ſo much as thinke (much
leſſe will or doe) the things that are of God, into that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie libertie,
which is the way vnto eternall life.</p>
            <p>We do therfore condemne them, who dream that the ſoules
ſeperated from their bodies are a ſleepe, and that they ſhall ariſe
togeather with the bodies: And we doe alſo deteſt the opinion of HYMENEVS
and PHILETVS, who did not diſtinguiſhe the ſpirituall from the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
reſurrection.</p>
            <p n="12">12 The Scripture declareth by manifeſt teſtimonies, that
the ſoules of the faithfull who die in the Lorde, are receiued of chriſt
into that eternal paradiſe, ſituated aboue all heauens, whervnto Chriſt
did aſcend, and that they are there conuerſant with Chriſt, being
partakers in their mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure of bleſſednes and felicity: wheras on the
other ſide, the word of GOD, and the conſideration of thinges that are
contrary, doe ſhew, that the ſoules of the wicked are thruſt into hell,
and there tormented in their manner.</p>
            <p n="13">13 The ſame bodies that lay down ſhal riſe, but not in
the ſame qualities, as the verie ſame body of Chriſt which was crucified
&amp; buried did ariſe, but not hauing thoſe qualities wherewith it was
endued when it was crucified, dead and <pb n="269" facs="tcp:1885:144"/> buried. Yet this
is the difference, in that the bodie of Chriſt felt no corruption, and
therefore did ouer-come the power and effect of death, euen in the verie
houſe of death: But our bodies are deliuered from corruption, which ſeemed
to haue bene able vtterlie, to haue aboliſhed them.</p>
            <p>Wee doe therefore condemne thoſe, who dream that the ſoules
hauing loſt their former bodies, by corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall aſſume other
bodies in their ſteede.</p>
            <p n="14">14 This change ſhall bee done at a moment in thoſe whome
Chriſt ſhall finde aliue at his ſecond comming.</p>
            <p n="15">15 The Axiome of the Philoſophers that the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
one thing, is the corruption of an other; hath no place in this matter: and the
ſimilitude of PAVLE drawne from the ſeed ſowen in the ground, is not to
be drawn anie farther, than vnto the change of the quality.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Wee affirme that the one and the ſelfe ſame man in
number ſhal ariſe, both in reſpect of his bodie, which is his matter; and
alſo in reſpect of his forme, that is, of his ſoule, which ſhall
quicken the one and the ſelfe ſame bodie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by the retaking againe
of the forme, the perſon might in a nice ſort ſeeme to be an other in
number, than it was before.</p>
            <p n="17">17 By reaſon of this change of the qualities, and not
becauſe the very bodilie quantity and circumſcription, are taken away (for
they are perpetuall circumſtances or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts of a bodie) PAVLE doth affirme
that the natural bodie is changed into a ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>Great therfore is their errour, and meerelie contrary vnto the
Reſurrection of the bodies, who teach that the bodies are eſſentiallie
changed by Reſurrection, into a ſpirituall nature. For by this meanes death
ſhould ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the nature of the bodie, as the Reſurrection cold
not reſtore the ſame, and the analogie alſo betweene Chriſts
Reſurrection &amp; the reſurrection of his members ſhould be
deſtroied.</p>
            <p n="18">18 By this means furthermore, the threatning of the
puniſhments of that aeternal fire and paine, ſhould be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether 
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1885:145"/> Allegoricall: yea, and after the reſurrection, both
the godlie and the wicked ſhuld become ſome third ſpirit compact or
braied together, as it were, of the natural ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the bodie
accidentallie transformed into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, either of the ſame, or of a
diuers ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="19">19 But they doe verie greeuouſlie erre, who imagine that
the bodie of Chriſt after his glorification, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued vpon his
Reſurrection, became not onelie of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall nature, (which though it
were graunted not to bee circumſcribed in regard of quantitie, yet they
muſt needs yeild, that the ſame is bounded within the propriety of the
nature of it) but alſo of a diuine; ſeeing the Deitie alone is euerie
where, by a proprietie altogether vncommunicable vnto anie thing els. Neither
hath the Reſurrection aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the true bodilie humaine nature of
Chriſt, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of his naturall bodie beeing laid aſide, God
hath endued the ſame humane nature, with moſt excellent ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
guifts.</p>
            <p n="20">20 The qualities of the bodies beeing glorified, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be
knowne vnto vs while we are in this life, neither are we curiouſlie to
enquire of them: Yet may it be gathered by the woordes of Chriſt, comparing
the Saincts vnto the brightneſſe of the Sunne, and affirming them to be
aequall with the Angels, by the ſtorie of the Reſurrection and
Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of Chriſt: &amp; alſo out of the firſt to the CORINTH. and
both the Epiſtles of PAVLE to the THESSALONIANS, that beſides their
incorruption, they ſhall bee alſo bright or ſhining, and of a more
refined &amp; quick ſubſtance, than now they are.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Of the contrarie ſide, it may in ſome ſort be
gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how horrible and fearefull the ſtate ſhall be of thoſe men,
who are to be adjudged vnto the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d death, which is the euerlaſting
curſe of God. Seeing their ſoules ſhall therefore neuer bee ſeperated
from their bodies, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that their vnſpeakable torments may be

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:1885:146"/> madnes.</p>
            <p>We do therefore condemne thoſe both olde and new writers, who
breaking into the ſecrets of God, do think that they can ſet downe, when
that day ſhall be, whereas the knowledge heereof is not giuen, no not to the
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelues.</p>
            <p n="14">14 It is our dutie therefore rather to be watchful, leaſt
being drowned with the delightes of the worlde, and the fleſh; and as it were
overwhelmed in a dead ſleepe, that laſt day do come vpon vs (being
vnprepared) at vnawares.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Now although the full perfection of that life, which wee
hope for, be referred vnto the very laſt day, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, it
taketh certaine beginnings in our mindes even while we are heere, when as the
holy Ghoſt dooth by the preaching of the worde, diſpell the darcknes of our
minde, and indue the ſame with the true knowledge of God, whence afterwarde
doth proceed a willing minde to obey his commandements, and that hope which
cannot deceaue them that beleeue.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Vnto this eternall life, which ſhall bring
vnſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble felicitie vnto the elect, death eternall is opoſed, which
ſhall bring vnto the wicked that deſtruction, which neuer ſhall haue an
end.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Even as that moſt happie felicitie, cannot nowe be
comprehended of vs: ſo alſo that miſerie of the damned is altogether
incomprehenſible.</p>
            <p n="18">18 This moſt horrible ſtate is called the ſecond death,
not becauſe that, either the ſoul is thereby ſeperated from the bodie, or
that the ſoule or the body of the damned do ſuffer death, but becauſe,
that as by the firſt death, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the ſoul of the wicked is
diſſolued, the one of them haſtning vnto putrefaction, the other going to
haue a taſt of the eternall paines; even ſo by this ſecond puniſhment
both the ſoule and the body are not only wholie excluded for euer from Gods
fauor, but alſo adjudged vnto his moſt fearefull and neuer ending
curſe.</p>
            <p n="19">19 For the like cauſe is this death called eternall fier,
becauſe that fier is a moſt ſharp &amp; vehement puniſhment: 
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1885:147"/> but wee are not here curiouſlie, to diſpute touching
the paines of Hell, leſt that wee thereby run into poeticall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
            <p n="20">20 Yet do theſe verie fables teach vs, that the doctrine
concerning the eternall puniſhment, which the wicked are to vnder goe euen
after this life, did alwaies ſound in the worlde.</p>
            <p>The Epicures therefore, and ſuch as deny the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallitie of the
ſoule, are confuted not onely by the word of God, but alſo by common
ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="21">21 That theſe puniſhments are eternall, whereunto
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life is opoſed, it is manifeſt by the expreſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

infinit nature of Gods majeſtie who is offended.</p>
            <p>The Church therfore juſtly condemned the Origeniſts, whoe
dreamed that the wicked and the Diuells them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, hauing fulfilled thoſe
puniſhments, ſhould at the length be deliuered.</p>
            <p n="22">22 Yet dooth our Sauiour Chriſt manifeſtlie witnes, MAT.
10.13. that the ſtate of the damned in reſpect of the meaſure of their
puniſhments ſhall not be alike.</p>
